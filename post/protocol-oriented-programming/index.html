<p>In Swift, protocol-oriented programming is in fashion. There&rsquo;s a lot of Swift code out there that&rsquo;s &ldquo;protocol-oriented&rdquo;, some open-source libraries even state it as a feature. I think protocols are heavily overused in Swift, and oftentimes the problem at hand can be solved in a much simpler way. In short: don&rsquo;t be dogmatic about using (or avoiding) protocols.</p>

<p>One of the most influential sessions at WWDC 2015 was called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/">Protocol-Oriented Programming in Swift</a>. It shows (among other things) that you can replace a class hierarchy (that is, a superclass and some subclasses) with a protocol-oriented solution (that is, a protocol and some types that conform to the protocol). The protocol-oriented solution is simpler, and more flexible. For example, a class can only have a single superclass, yet a type can conform to many protocols.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the problem they solved in the WWDC talk. A series of drawing commands needed to be rendered as a graphic, as well as logged to the console. By putting the drawing commands in a protocol, any code that describes a drawing could be phrased in terms of the protocol&rsquo;s methods. Protocol extensions allow you to define new drawing functionality in terms of the protocol&rsquo;s base functionality, and every type that conforms gets the new functionality for free.</p>

<p>In the example above, protocols solve the problem of sharing code between multiple types. In Swift&rsquo;s Standard Library, protocols are heavily used for collections, and they solve exactly the same problem. Because <code>dropFirst</code> is defined on the <code>Collection</code> type, all the collection types get this for free! At the same time, there are so many collection-related protocols and types, that it can be hard to find things. That&rsquo;s one drawback of protocols, yet the advantages easily outweigh the disadvantages in the case of the Standard Library.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s work our way through an example. Here, we have a Webservice class. It loads entities from the network using <code>URLSession</code>. (It doesn&rsquo;t actually load things, but you get the idea):</p>

<pre><code>class Webservice {
    func loadUser() -&gt; User? {
        let json = self.load(URL(string: &quot;/users/current&quot;)!)
        return User(json: json)
    }
    
    func loadEpisode() -&gt; Episode? {
        let json = self.load(URL(string: &quot;/episodes/latest&quot;)!)
        return Episode(json: json)
    }
    
    private func load(_ url: URL) -&gt; [AnyHashable:Any] {
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url)
        // etc.
        return [:] // should come from the server
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code above is short and works fine. There is no problem, until we want to test <code>loadUser</code> and <code>loadEpisode</code>. Now we either have to stub <code>load</code>, or pass in a mock <code>URLSession</code> using dependency injection. We could also define a protocol that <code>URLSession</code> conforms to and then pass in a test instance. However, in this case, the solution is much simpler: we can pull the changing parts out of the <code>Webservice</code> and into a struct (we also cover this in <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E01-networking">Swift Talk Episode 1</a> and in <a href="https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/">Advanced Swift</a>):</p>

<pre><code>struct Resource&lt;A&gt; {
    let url: URL
    let parse: ([AnyHashable:Any]) -&gt; A
}

class Webservice {
    let user = Resource&lt;User&gt;(url: URL(string: &quot;/users/current&quot;)!, parse: User.init)
    let episode = Resource&lt;Episode&gt;(url: URL(string: &quot;/episodes/latest&quot;)!, parse: Episode.init)
    
    private func load&lt;A&gt;(resource: Resource&lt;A&gt;) -&gt; A {
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: resource.url)
        // load asynchronously, parse the JSON, etc. For the sake of the example, we directly return an empty result.
        let json: [AnyHashable:Any] = [:] // should come from the server
        return resource.parse(json)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we can test <code>user</code> and <code>episode</code> without having to mock anything: they&rsquo;re simple struct values. We still have to test <code>load</code>, but that&rsquo;s only one method (instead of for each resource). Now let&rsquo;s add some protocols.</p>

<p>Instead of the <code>parse</code> function, we could create a protocol for types that can be initialized from JSON.</p>

<pre><code>protocol FromJSON {
    init(json: [AnyHashable:Any])
}

struct Resource&lt;A: FromJSON&gt; {
    let url: URL
}

class Webservice {
    let user = Resource&lt;User&gt;(url: URL(string: &quot;/users/current&quot;)!)
    let episode = Resource&lt;Episode&gt;(url: URL(string: &quot;/episodes/latest&quot;)!)
    
    private func load&lt;A&gt;(resource: Resource&lt;A&gt;) -&gt; A {
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: resource.url)
        // load asynchronously, parse the JSON, etc. For the sake of the example, we directly return an empty result.
        let json: [AnyHashable:Any] = [:] // should come from the server
        return A(json: json)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code above might look simpler, but it&rsquo;s also way less flexible. For example, how would you define a resource that has an array of <code>User</code> values? (In the protocol-oriented example above, that&rsquo;s not yet possible, and we&rsquo;ll have to wait for Swift 4 or 5 until this is expressible). The protocol makes things simpler, but I think it doesn&rsquo;t pay for itself, because it dramatically decreases the ways in which we can create a <code>Resource</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of having the <code>user</code> and <code>episode</code> as <code>Resource</code> values, we could also make <code>Resource</code> a protocol and have <code>UserResource</code> and <code>EpisodeResource</code> structs. This seems to be a popular thing to do, because having a type instead of a value &ldquo;just feels right&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code>protocol Resource {
    associatedtype Result
    var url: URL { get }
    func parse(json: [AnyHashable:Any]) -&gt; Result
}

struct UserResource: Resource {
    let url = URL(string: &quot;/users/current&quot;)!
    func parse(json: [AnyHashable : Any]) -&gt; User {
        return User(json: json)
    }
}

struct EpisodeResource: Resource {
    let url = URL(string: &quot;/episodes/latest&quot;)!
    func parse(json: [AnyHashable : Any]) -&gt; Episode {
        return Episode(json: json)
    }
}

class Webservice {
    private func load&lt;R: Resource&gt;(resource: R) -&gt; R.Result {
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: resource.url)
        // load asynchronously, parse the JSON, etc. For the sake of the example, we directly return an empty result.
        let json: [AnyHashable:Any] = [:]
        return resource.parse(json: json)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But if we look at it critically, what did we really gain? The code became longer, more complex and less direct. And because of the associated type, we&rsquo;ll probably end up defining an <code>AnyResource</code> eventually. Is there any benefit to having an <code>EpisodeResource</code> struct instead of an <code>episodeResource</code> value? They are both global definitions. For the struct, the name starts with an uppercase letter, and for the value, a lowercase letter. Other than that, there really isn&rsquo;t any advantage. You can both namespace them (for autocompletion). So in this case, having a value is definitely simpler and shorter.</p>

<p>There are many other examples I&rsquo;ve seen in code around the internet. For example, I&rsquo;ve seen a protocol like this:</p>

<pre><code>protocol URLStringConvertible {
    var urlString: String { get }
}

// Somewhere later

func sendRequest(urlString: URLStringConvertible, method: ...) {
    let string = urlString.urlString
}
</code></pre>

<p>What does this buy you? Why not simply remove the protocol and pass in the <code>urlString</code> directly? Much simpler. Or a protocol with a single method:</p>

<pre><code>protocol RequestAdapter {
    func adapt(_ urlRequest: URLRequest) throws -&gt; URLRequest
}
</code></pre>

<p>A bit more controversial: why not simply remove the protocol, and pass in a function somewhere? Much simpler. (Unless your protocol is a class-only protocol and you want a weak reference it).</p>

<p>I can keep showing examples, but I hope the point is clear. Often, there are simpler choices. More abstractly, protocols are just one way to achieve polymorphic code. There are many other ways: subclassing, generics, values, functions, and so on. Values (e.g. a <code>String</code> instead of a <code>URLStringConvertible</code>) are the simplest way. Functions (e.g. <code>adapt</code> instead of <code>RequestAdapter</code>) are a bit more complex than values, but are still simple. Generics (without any constraints) are simpler than protocols. And to be complete, protocols are often simpler than class hierarchies.</p>

<p>A useful heuristic might be to think about whether your protocol models data or behavior. For data, a struct is probably easier. For complex behavior (e.g. a delegate with multiple methods), a protocol is often easier. (The standard library&rsquo;s collection protocols are a bit special: they don&rsquo;t really describe data, but rather, they describe data manipulation.)</p>

<p>That said, protocols can be very useful. But don&rsquo;t start with a protocol just for the sake of protocol-oriented programming. Start by looking at your problem, and try to solve it in the simplest way possible. Let the problem drive the solution, not the other way around. Protocol-oriented programming isn&rsquo;t inherently good or bad. Just like any other technique (functional programming, OO, dependency injection, subclassing) it can be used to solve a problem, and we should try to pick the right tool for the job. Sometimes that&rsquo;s a protocol, but often, there&rsquo;s a simpler way.</p>
