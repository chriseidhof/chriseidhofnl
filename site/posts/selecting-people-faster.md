title: Selecting People Faster
---

Today, I fixed some minor things in the code, and simplified the workflow. In
the previous version, when checking in, you were presented with a list of
people. After that, you could do the checkin.&#10;

In the current version, it works much like sending an email or sms: you start by
typing somebody’s name, and you will see a list of people below (see the
screenshot). After you click on a name, you can continue with typing the note.
This makes adding a note (the most important workflow in the app) a lot
faster.&#10;

Tomorrow, I will be travelling again. Part of it will be the three hour train
ride from Granada to Seville, which means I will have some time for hacking. I’m
hoping to implement the grouping by first letter for the People view (just like
in Address Book) and start work on the search functionality (which means I will
have to compile my own version of sqlite).&#10;

The app is almost ready for beta testing. If you plan on using this app, please
[send me an email](mailto:chris+beta@eidhof.nl) and I will send you
instructions.&#10;
