We got our internet access at the new house. We also won't move before the end of March, probably even a bit later, but at least that part is working. We had a bit of a setback this week, as we found out that the plastering will take quite a bit longer than calculated. It's a big chain of dependencies: we can't paint before we've plastered, we can't lay the floor before we've painted, and we can't start plastering before the new window frames are installed (which should happen next week!).

My best friend from The Netherlands came over, we just hung out, did a little bit of work on the house together (we put up a new bathroom ceiling). I made bagels, which turned out much tastier than last week, and they looked good, too!

As I'm quite pressed for time these days, I need to be a bit creative about combining activities. I ran with the youngest in the running stroller (she gets to sleep, the rest of the family gets a break, and I get to do some exercise). Also, we bought a cargo bike last year, and it arrived last fall. Every time I go to our new house I bring a few boxes.

I've been using our cargo bike to transport kids (it fits a baby car seat and two small kids), transport building materials (although 6 bags of cement was a bit over the limit), and I've already filled it up many times to move stuff over to the new house.

I ordered "Airlineschienen" (I think it's called L-Track in English?) to attach to the inside of the cargo box. This will let me flexibly attach a bunch of stuff, and should help me strap down the load. I'll also use them to attach hooks for shopping bags (they tend to fall over when small), kids backpacks, etc. 

We ran a two-day workshop, this time in CEST for a small-ish agency. It was really nice to have people in the workshop that already had a bunch of SwiftUI experience, we could go much deeper into the material and
