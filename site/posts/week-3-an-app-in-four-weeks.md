title: "Week 3: An App in Four Weeks"
---

Today marks the end of Week 3 of my [App in Four
Weeks](/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff) challenge.&#10;

This week I [chose a name](/post/introducing-met). I designed an
icon and overall style for the app. I then spent quite some time implementing
autorotation, and getting it exactly right. There is now a passcode lock
too.&#10;

By nature, I am not a perfectionist. Whenever I see that something works, I tend
to lose interest in finishing it. For me, shipping things is a big deal, and
hard to do. Normally, I lack the willpower to do polish and finish things. By
making a very public commitment to build this app in four weeks, and by writing
about it here, I can outsource my willpower: polishing and shipping becomes a
lot easier. Delivering a bad app or not delivering at all would feel like a big
embarrassment.&#10;

So far, the process has been a marvelous experience. I had so much help from
everybody: people who have feature requests, name suggestions, design
suggestions, beta testers, people who tell me that they like this blog, and so
on. If you consider doing something similar, I can only recommend it. My work
becomes a lot better by doing this, and people who read this hopefully learn and
get inspired, a win-win situation.&#10;

Next week, I will not add any new big features, but instead polish what I have
so far, set up a website and make a marketing plan. From Wednesday on I am
volunteering at multi-day trail race, so I am not sure how much time I will have
to work on Met.&#10;

If there is any part of the process that you would like me to write about,
please let me know.&#10;
