I hate flossing. My dentist insists that I do it, and after each visit I
promised to do better next time, but never followed through. I wanted to, but I
lacked the discipline to do it.&#10;

Some two months ago, I decided to do it differently. Instead of using my
willpower, I tricked myself into creating a habit. I grabbed a big piece of
paper, made rows and columns, creating about 60 large squares.&#10;

Each day, after flossing, I would draw something in the square. At the
beginning, it was just a cross. But my drawings became much more advanced, and
something to look forward to. After 3 days, it was already hard to break the
pattern, even though I still hated flossing.&#10;

This week I’m traveling, and I didn’t bring my piece of paper (which is
completely filled, anyway). However, I did bring my dental floss, and just
yesterday I noticed it has become a complete habit. I don’t think about it
anymore, except when I forget it. Then I still do it.&#10;

I didn’t think of this trick myself, by the way. I once read about it on
Lifehacker, as it’s also know as [Seinfeld’s Productivity
Secret](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret). Over
the next months, I’ll probably reuse it for other habits I’d like to
instill.&#10;
