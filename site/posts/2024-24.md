I ran another workshop (distributed across Australia, India and Turkey). I also started helping out at our local hackerspace again by teaching kids HTML for a few weeks. I went to Berlin and had my professional picture taken, and recorded [Swift Talk episodes](https://talk.objc.io/).

Last week, I went to Cupertino for WWDC. It was so good seeing everyone again. I did not win the WWDC lottery but went to [One More Thing](https://omt-conf.com) instead, and met a bunch of friends around that. Afterwards, I spent a night with friends in San Francisco and went for some really nice runs.

The upcoming week marks one of the final workshops for a while -- now it's time to focus on the [Field Guide](https://www.swiftuifieldguide.com) again.
