Last week was more personal stuff and less work. I spent a morning teaching a zine workshop to primary school kids, which was really fun. One of our kids was sick and I had to take care of her for a day, which only left three short days of work time. I spent an evening rehearsing a short play with other parents for the day care. I think the last time I was in a play was almost thirty years ago.

Because of weather and responsibilities, I cycled indoors quite a bit (instead of in the forest). This is definitely better than running on the treadmill (which I used to do a few years ago). A lot more comfortable and not as loud.

I recorded short videos and posted them on Bluesky and Mastodon (hope to keep doing that for the rest of December):

- [How to use Flexible Frames](https://bsky.app/profile/eidhof.nl/post/3lccp3fl2xs2z)
- [Image Resizing and Aspect Ratio](https://bsky.app/profile/eidhof.nl/post/3lcf64ao7vk2n)
- [Scaled Metric](https://bsky.app/profile/eidhof.nl/post/3lchrl3jtbs2v)
- [Text](https://bsky.app/profile/eidhof.nl/post/3lcmrzsuyl22u)

I spent more time figuring out how the attribute graph works. At the same time, I tried porting some of GraphViz's layout algorithm to SwiftUI. 

I had a call with Nathan from [Retcon](https://retcon.app). We talked about a bunch of stuff, but one quote really stuck with me: "when designing puzzles in games, the designers want people to try the wrong solution first". I always feel anytime we make a mistake and later do it right, learning is much better. Maybe I could use this as inspiration for my teaching.
