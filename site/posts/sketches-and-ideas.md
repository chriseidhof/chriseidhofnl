title: Sketches and ideas
---

Although I was traveling yesterday, I sketched some small mockups for the
Contacts app. The idea for the app had come when the genius Lucas Tieleman
explained to me how he keeps a small book with notes about everyone. Yesterday
he sent an email with the notes he had about me: it’s fun and only freaked me
out a little bit (not as much as I expected). He’s a very early adopter of new
technology, and he wanted this on his iPhone.&#10;

One of the things he suggested was adding a game element. I’m not sure if that’s
a good idea: although it would be fun at first, I think game elements get
annoying later. One “game-ish” option would be to have a calendar view showing
how many notes you made that day, and when you see it you will want to have at
least one note a day (hopefully).&#10;

[Eelco](http://tupil.com) also pointed out [With](http://with.me/) by Path. Just
like [Hashable](http://hashable.com/beta): while there is great inspiration in
there, I think they both focus way too much on social networks and sharing.
Especially for the purpose I had in mind (taking notes about people) this is
scary. As Lucas also noted: some if this stuff is really private.&#10;

Today I’ll probably start a new XCode project and quickly implement an app
that’s usable for me, and iterate upon that. For now, here’s two of the
sketches I made yesterday (although they are already outdated):&#10;
