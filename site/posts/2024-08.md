Last week I had to prepare a bunch of other things (workshops, start on a presentation) and only had limited time for the Field Guide. I also wanted to recover a bit from pushing myself. It's kind of similar to running training: to achieve things on the short term, you need to push yourself out of your comfort zone, to achieve things on the long term, you need to then recover from that.

I did manage to write a section about [Building a Flow Layout](https://www.swiftuifieldguide.com/layout/layout/#flowLayout). Because that section has a number of larger code blocks with no direct preview, we added little "info" icons in the gutter of the code. These highlight specific lines and show a small tooltip with an explanation. We also added code folding. Both of hopefully make the examples a little friendlier (yet, if you want to really understand what's happening you'll still need to struggle through the code, there's no way around that). By the way, when I say "we", I mean [Nick](https://nicholaschristowitz.com/projects/swiftuifieldguide/) and me. The entire site is a close collaboration between him designing and me implementing everything.

I had a good week of running as well, adding up to 123km. I'm not sure if I'll ever make the time to get in PB shape again (it just requires a lot of training for me), I think I should be able to comfortably run a sub 3 marathon again.
