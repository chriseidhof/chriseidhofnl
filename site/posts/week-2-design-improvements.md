This post is about Week 2 of my [One App in Four
Weeks](/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff) project.&#10;

This week was a bit strange, in many ways. For me, it didn’t feel like a
productive week. On Monday and Tuesday I got some things done, Wednesday I was
travelling (but thinking) and Thursday I spent most of the day creating a custom
design in Photoshop. I then decided that it wasn’t good enough. Instead, I chose
to go for the default styles used in all of Apple’s apps and Twitter. If it is
good enough for [Loren Brichter](http://www.atebits.com/), it is good enough for
me.&#10;

I didn’t implement search functionality yet. Because I had to do lots of messy
stuff (such as creating a custom version of sqlite), I stepped back and thought
about whether I would need it. For now, I’ll stay lean and not add it, and see
if it will become necessary.&#10;

I also removed the location feature (because it wasn’t implemented yet). I don’t
think it is necessary, although it would make a nice add-on. I look forward to
the beta-testers’ feedback to see what they think of it.&#10;

Today I spent polishing the features I had, trying to minimize the UI and keep
everything very simple. The app is now quite minimal, but it does the job. Now
it’s time to send out some beta’s\!&#10;
