title: My presentation at the Berlin HUG
---

Last week I gave a short presentation about lenses and
[fclabels](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fclabels) at the Berlin Haskell
Users Group. The source for the slides and some accompanying literate Haskell
files are now in a [github
repo](https://github.com/chriseidhof/presentation-lenses).&#10;
