title: New build, first website, press plans
---

Yesterday I released a new build. In this version, you can also change the date
of events (which means you can add past events) and add new contacts from within
the app.&#10;

Today I set up a [first webpage](http://eidhof.nl/met/) for Met. I really like
the design of With, and I let myself be inspired. Admittedly, the website is
quite minimal, but I think it should be enough (for now). I also found a good
domain name, which I’m in the process of registering now.&#10;

I want to do multivariate testing on the website background, slogan and text,
but can of course only do this once I’ve got some traffic going. Which raises
another question: how are people going to find me?&#10;

In the past, I’ve had good experiences with sending press releases to Dutch
weblogs such as [iPhoneClub](http://iphoneclub.nl) and
[OneMoreThing](http://www.onemorething.nl/). In addition to this, I also would
like to get featured on English-language iPhone sites, and sites such as
[LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com/). First I need to compile a list of sites
that could potentially feature me, then I need to write a press release and send
it to all of them.&#10;

As always, if you have tips or suggestions let me know.&#10;
