title: "LLMs vs Coding Manually"

I've been experimenting with LLMs a bit over the years. I think they are incredibly useful, despite all their flaws. I did two experiments where I had Cursor / Claude Code build stuff. In one experiment it worked really well, in another experiment I was more hands-off with results that weren't as good. I think most of the problems I encountered can be solved through better prompting.

In the best case, the LLM can write code much faster than I can. This has been great for basic stuff and prototyping. However, for code that really matters (e.g. the core of a library) it's not just about writing the code, I also have to understand it. And when I'm lazy, the understanding part is easy to skip.

When I write code myself, I understand it, because I just wrote it. I know exactly how it works and it's exactly how I wanted it to work. While there might still be bugs or a flawed architecture, at least I understand exactly what I did. Depending on the project, this is very important to me. While I'd love to hand over more things to LLMs, I feel like it's more efficient to write the code that matters myself, rather than having an LLM do it.
