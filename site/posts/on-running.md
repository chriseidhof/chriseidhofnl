title: On Running
---

Running gives me a lot of energy. After a run, there is the runner’s high: the
released endorphin in my brain makes me feel great.&#10;

Training, races and continually wanting to get better makes me push myself. I’m
not pushing too much, for risk of over-training, but I am constantly overcoming
barriers and improving. After running my first half marathon a few years ago, I
felt on top of the world, and that feeling lasted an entire week. The
achievement made everything else in life seem so easy in comparison.&#10;

Running keeps my body fit, which helps for my mind too. I feel happier and more
creative. Some therapists prescribe running to depressed people, as it can
relieve stress and anxiety.&#10;

Being an avid runner, I also like to watch other runners. Seeing people break
world records or their own personal best is very inspiring. Watching a 73-year
old man run 160 kilometers (100 miles) through the mountains is even better.
Being a runner myself makes me appreciate these things even more.&#10;

Running also brings me discipline. I have carried that discipline into other
areas of my life as well. It takes a bit to get started with running, but once
you are going out on a regular schedule, you feel more disciplined and better
about yourself. Enjoy\!&#10;
