title: Check In to People
---

As I wrote in [yesterday’s
post](/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff), I’m going to build an
app in four weeks. Now I’ve chosen the idea that I’m going to build: check in to
people. This will give you an archive of when you met people. After you check
in, you can add notes and maybe pictures.&#10;

Yesterday I’ve thought about the next steps and about the minimum viable
product, and researched existing apps.&#10;

*Existing Software*

It looks like there is one app that does something similar, it’s called
[FellowUp](http://www.fellowup.com/). However, it doesn’t include the time
aspect as much as I want to.&#10;

I also stumbled on a blog post by Loic Le Meur, founder of Seesmic and
LeWeb.net, who describes a [Personal
CRM](http://loiclemeur.com/english/2011/03/its-time-for-personal-asshole-proof-crm.html)
system. This is some nice validation. People like Loic are my potential
market.&#10;

*MVP*

The Minimum Viable Product is an app with two features: check in and review. If
you press “Check In”, you can choose a person from your Address Book (or add
somebody). Then you can choose the date and time (which is pre-set to the
current date and time). You can add notes directly, or later on.&#10;

If you press “People”, you get a list of your contacts. You can browse them
alphabetically, and selecting a contact gives you the full history of your
check-ins with that person.&#10;

Finally, if you press “Archive” you get a list of your check-ins, sorted by
date. For example, if you use Getting Things Done you can use it for your weekly
reviews.&#10;

There are a *lot* of other features I thought of, but this will be the MVP.&#10;

*Business Model*

I can see two straightforward options for the business model: a free app that
allows you to purchase extra features or a paid app. A third option would be to
have a subscription service, but I think that should only be done if there is a
server component included (for example, a plugin in GMail). I have to think of a
good price. Because it’s a niche app, it won’t be 99 cents, but probably
something like $4.99. Any tips on the pricing would be much appreciated.&#10;

*Next Steps*

  - Start drawing prototypes

  - Think about who my market is, exactly, and how to market it to them

  - Think about the branding of the app (name, visual design, icon)

  - Build a working prototype

As always, the marketing will be the most difficult for me. I’ll have to think
hard about that.&#10;

*Update*

Right after publishing this post, I found out about
[Hashable](http://hashable.com/). It’s a very similar tool, however, it’s a
service that requires you to login, and it’s social (you can share things with
people). I envisioned a product where everything stays on your iPhone. I’ll have
to think if this is a good reason to quit the project or if it’s the perfect
validation.&#10;
