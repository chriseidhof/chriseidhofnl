title: I shipped my first product
---

Today, the first version of [TrackMe](http://eidhof.nl/trackme/) is available
from the [App
Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trackme/id454704336?ls=1&mt=8). This is my
first product as an indie developer, and even though it’s very simple, I’m proud
to have gone through the cycle of getting the idea, building it and releasing
it.&#10;

As you can read in my post [The Big Plan](/post/8336661854/the-big-plan), one of
the things I find difficult is shipping software. Specifically: my own software.
It’s different when you build something for a client or for a boss.&#10;

I already submitted the next update to the App Store, as I accidentally didn’t
check whether the retina icon was working, and I fixed a small bug.&#10;

I am strongly thinking of open sourcing the app as well (next to having it in
the App Store). My guess is that this will help people to analyze and trust the
app, and that it might be free promotion. What do you think?&#10;
