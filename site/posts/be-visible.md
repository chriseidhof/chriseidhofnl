Whatever you are doing, make sure you’re visible. Don’t fear embarrassment and
publish yourself, in whichever form. Here are three stories:&#10;

**Twitter**

As I wrote in an [earlier post](/post/9873846899/ive-got-an-idea-for-an-app), I
became iPhone developer by chance. Just for fun, we created a game called
[CookieCombo](http://cookiecombo.com/) to play around with the iPhone SDK, which
came out a few months earlier. We tweeted about it, and got two instant gigs out
of it: we built the app for Wakoopa and the app for NRC (a leading Dutch
newspaper). After that, we were the guys who built NRC, and got many gigs out of
that.&#10;

**Blogging**

Since I started blogging, I got a lot of followers on Twitter, on Tumblr and a
lot of email. I’m definitely not the best developer out there (although I
consider myself competent enough), but I am easy to find. People stumble upon my
blog, and come to me with their iPhone idea.&#10;

**Speaking**

By speaking at small meetups or conferences, I made a lot of friends. If you
write or speak about a topic, people consider you an expert. When I was
freelancing, a lot of people referred potential clients to me, because they
remembered me from one of these events.&#10;

The key takeaway point is: be publicly visible. Put yourself out there: write,
speak, blog, tweet, help, teach, email, whatever works for you. This has the
awesome side effect that *people find you*. Instead of having to search for
clients, they come to you. Instead of having to find a good designer for your
project, they might approach you because they want to work with you.&#10;
