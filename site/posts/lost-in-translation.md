One of the hardest part in software development is communication. I don’t mean
network communication, but person-to-person communication. This is one reason
why it’s so convenient to work alone on your pet projects: you don’t have to
communicate at all.&#10;

Every time you communicate, there is noise in the signal. Because both parties
have different backgrounds, you lose part of the message whenever you talk to
somebody else. In general, the more similar the backgounds (e.g. two programmers
talking to each other), the smaller the error rate.&#10;

It is extremely important to realize this, especially when talking to people
outside of your occupation. On of the best examples I’ve seen was by [Sam
Aaron](http://sam.aaron.name/). A few years ago, he showed me a DSL he
implemented in Ruby to encode his clients’ logic. In true DSL fashion, his
language exactly described their problem domain, and his program exactly
specified the way he solved their problems.&#10;

Together with the client, Sam sat down and looked at the code. The client wasn’t
able to program at all, but was able to read what Sam wrote. Together, they did
some pair-programming to fix the logical errors that got lost during
communication. This is a prime example of domain specific languages, and one of
the best examples of clear communication in software I’ve seen so far.&#10;
