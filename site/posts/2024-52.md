Just to be consistent I'll add the notes for this week as well. Mostly had family time and managed to put in a few longer but very cold bike rides.

We took the train to The Netherlands, the bike rides here are cold as well. I rented a gravel bike which is really nice (even though the brakes don't really work all that well, so I'll bring my own bike next time).

I've spent a bit of time on preparing upcoming workshops, we recorded another Swift Talk episode and I played around a bit with Helix. For Helix, I installed [Marksman](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman) to get nice Markdown autocompletion. It supports wiki-like syntax so that I can edit my Zettelkasten notes as well (although I prefer the more integrated workflow of The Archive).
