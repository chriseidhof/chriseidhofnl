Not too long ago, I went through a breakup, or to put it another way: I got
dumped. Fortunately, this wasn’t the first time I went through a breakup.
Everybody handles it differently, but these are the sort of things that help me
deal with it:&#10;

I meet a lot of friends and talk about it. I go out to bars where nice girls
hang out, just to reassure myself that there are more girls out there. I try to
sleep a lot, eat healthy, exercise: take good care of myself. I change something
in my life, sometimes radical, sometimes not so radical. Make some new
friends.&#10;

I never come back together, and don’t even consider the possibility. This makes
letting go easier. Until I’m completely over it, and longer, I try to minimize
the contact. I accept the situation, no matter what the reasons for the breakup
are. Even if I don’t know the reasons.&#10;

After living together, moving out of the place makes it easier. Otherwise I’ll
keep hoping she might be there when I hear a noise or get home.&#10;

Breakups suck for the most part, but there are upsides too: I have a lot more
free time. I can do whatever I want to, no concessions. I will fall in love
again. And perhaps the biggest, most immediate upside: I’m reminded once again
that I’ve got awesome friends and family (thanks guys\!).&#10;
