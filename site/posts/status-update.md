Lots of stuff happened over the last months, so here’s a partial list:&#10;

  - I finished my project with [Aprendo](http://www.aprendo.nl). We’ve been
    working on an in-house iPad app for almost a year. At this point, I can’t
    demo anything publicly, but I’d be happy to talk about it in private.

  - I organized [UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com) together with
    [Peter](http://twitter.com/peterbihr) and
    [Matt](http://twitter.com/fidothe). I think it’s safe to say that the
    conference was a resounding success. We learned a lot of things that we can
    do better next year, but all in all, we’re very happy.

  - I started [objc.io](http://objc.io), a new online periodical about best
    practices and techniques in Objective-C. The response so far has been very
    good, and matches the amount of work we’ve put in.

  - I started work on a small app to track your food intake, based on the Diet
    Quality Score system.

  - I started planning to build independent apps together with
    [Florian](http://floriankugler.com).

  - The running is going well, too, I improved my PB on the 10K in bad
    circumstances to 37:03, and will run my [first
    marathon](http://www.skogsmaraton.no) this weekend (although I have a slight
    injury, so depending on how that feels I might pull out at the last minute).

Depending on the contracting work I might have more time to blog. I have a lot
of topics in my head, some might appear here and some on
[objc.io](http://objc.io).&#10;
