In case you haven’t noticed yet, I’m organizing an English-speaking iOS
Conference in Berlin called [UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com), together with my
fellow organizers [Matt](http://twitter.com/fidothe) and
[Peter](http://twitter.com/peterbihr). If you are in or around Berlin on
May 2nd, get on the [mailing list](http://iosinberlin.launchrock.com) and come
join us\!&#10;

Organizing this conference is really awesome. It started with a question: why
doesn’t this conference exist? Then I realized that the only way to make it
happen is do it yourself. Starting something like this feels really empowering:
we can definitely have an impact on our direct environment by just doing stuff.
I asked some people that are more awesome and experienced than myself, then we
executed.&#10;

While UIKonf is still a few months away, I am getting better at shipping, and I
can recommend you to do the same. Instead of reading this, write an article.
Package up some software or libraries you have lying around. Organize a meetup.
You’ll see that it’ll make you happy\!&#10;

A good recommendation from my friend [Alper](http://alper.nl/dingen/) is the
[Cult of
Done](http://www.brepettis.com/blog/2009/3/3/the-cult-of-done-manifesto.html)
manifesto. Take a minute or two to read it, and then get back at building stuff
and shipping things\!&#10;
