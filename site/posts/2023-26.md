We were busy last week getting the layout chapter out, which is probably the chapter I'm most proud of. There's still a lot more we could say about SwiftUI's layout behavior, but I think it's long enough already. We put a lot of effort into the explanations, I especially like the alignment explanations. We also prepared and recorded two more episodes. 

I started working on my talk for the upcoming [Swift TO](https://www.swiftconf.to) conference. Really looking forward to that. I made a little presentation helper for SwiftUI so I can use that to give my presentation.

At home, I dug up most of the front garden. There were all kinds of weeds, large stones, large metal rods and other stuff. It feels like the previous owners haven't really maintained it during the last few years, so we wanted a clean start.
