title: Beta and Branding

This is the start of week 3 of my [One App in Four
Weeks](/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff) project. Last Friday, I
sent out the first beta version, and just sent an update (with mostly
bugfixes).&#10;

[Martijn Reintjes](http://martijnreintjes.com/) suggested that I should change
Checkins to Meetups, and I couldn’t agree more. I wasn’t happy with Checkins to
start with, and this makes it a lot simpler. Thanks dude\!&#10;

Because I wanted to be future-proof, I decided to change it everywhere in the
code too. This took a while, refactoring all the code and setting up a Core Data
migration. It turns out that XCode 4 is still a bit buggy when it comes to
migrations, but after trying the same thing three times it worked
(seriously).&#10;

This weekend I was thinking about the name and branding. I currently have two
options:&#10;

**Meetups**

This name describes exactly what it does. Meetups. There is no other app with
that name yet, although there is the Meetup.com platform, which might be
confusing.&#10;

**James**

This is the name I like the most so far: calling it James. James helps you to
record who you meet. James treats your information as confidential. James
doesn’t get in the way. James is personal. I was thinking of using an image
similar to this for the logo:&#10;

As always, let me know what you think: send an email or mention/message me on
Twitter.&#10;
