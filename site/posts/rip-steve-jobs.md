title: RIP Steve Jobs

When I started to read the news this morning, I couldn’t believe it. It felt
very surreal. Not completely awake yet, I opened up other news sites to make
sure it wasn’t a mistake.&#10;

I’m not sure how I feel. Mostly, I feel love. I am impressed by the products
Apple made and the inspiration they gave everybody. If there’s one company that
I love, it must be Apple. And loving Apple implies loving Steve Jobs.&#10;

As [Marco said](http://www.marco.org/2011/10/05/steve-jobs-dies), I don’t feel
at all qualified to write this, but it feels inappropriate to do something
else.&#10;

Thank you for everything.&#10;
