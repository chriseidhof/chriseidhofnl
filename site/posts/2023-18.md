For our book, I added support to draw nicer diagrams (with overlays on the arrows placed in exactly the right spot). I also changed the syntax highlighting so that we can generate custom attributed strings for certain parts. You can see both parts in action in [this post](https://m.objc.io/@chris/110304502914075277).

We also finally moved into our new house! It's not finished yet, so we had to already move between the two floors twice, but by next week we'll (hopefully) have a finished kitchen, finished bathrooms and a ground floor that's completely done.
