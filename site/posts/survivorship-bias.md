title: Survivorship bias
---

Of all the jobs I’ve had, being a solo entrepreneur is the fairest job. I am
directly responsible for my own income. I have nobody to blame if things go
wrong, technically, financially or otherwise. This makes me feel very
responsible for everything I do. Compared to working with more than one person
or (worse) working in a company, my work influences my results so much
more.&#10;

The danger is this: if I become very successful, I will probably attribute it to
my skill. However, there are a lot of other factors that influence my succes,
and I have the feeling that luck might be quite a big factor.&#10;

This post is for future me: if you do succeed, don’t think it’s only because
you’re so smart or skilled. Read again about [surviorship
bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias).&#10;
