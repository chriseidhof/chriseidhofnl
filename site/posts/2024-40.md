Last week I went to Paris to speak at [Swift Connection](https://swiftconnection.io). This was really fun — I met new and old friends and it was generally really nice to be among other Swift developers (in our tiny town I'm the only one).

My presentation was about different techniques available for building SwiftUI animations. This was the first time I used the new "play back typing" tool during a presentation. This went really well, there was a small hiccup but luckily someone in the audience caught it and called it out. While the talk was still fresh I recorded a version at home and [published it here](https://chris.eidhof.nl/presentations/swiftui-animations/). 

The train ride back from Paris to Fürstenberg went well, too. I was able to spend a lot of that time working productively. I have no numbers, but when I think about it purely in terms of efficiency: the whole hassle of flying (going to the airport, waiting, checking in, and so on) is a lot more stressful to me, and I wonder if I could have gotten any more work done, even with the few hours saved.
