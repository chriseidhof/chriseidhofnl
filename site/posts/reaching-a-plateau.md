title: Reaching a plateau
---

While I was traveling last month, I met a lot of great people. One of them was
a 73-year old woman who had been very successful in her life. She was a
professor at a well-known university in the USA and has now retired to Spain.
She is still doing amazing things.&#10;

I asked her: “What’s your secret to success, apart from working hard and being
intelligent?”. She said: “Nothing, just that”.&#10;

Then I wanted to know if she had ever felt burned out, or felt like quitting.
She answered: “Yes. The first time it’s very scary. However, every time this
happened I had reached some kind of plateau, and it was time to take the next
step. Each time, I just waited it out and grew. The next times, I started to
recognize it when it happened and slowly advanced to the next level in my
career.”&#10;
