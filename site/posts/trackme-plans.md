Last month, I made € 99.54 from selling [TrackMe](http://eidhof.nl/trackme). The
first day I sold about 60 copies, and the rest of the sales was spread out over
the month.&#10;

The reason why I sold so little is that I didn’t do any marketing. I set up a
blog for the app, and talked about it on this blog. I announced it on Twitter,
and wrote a blog post about [10 cool things you can do with a GPX
file](http://trackmeapp.tumblr.com/post/9920687010/10-cool-things-you-can-do-with-a-gpx-file).
I would promote it more under my own account, but don’t want to be spammy.&#10;

Over the last weeks, a friend has written a (Dutch) [press
release](http://eidhof.nl/trackme/press/release-2011-09-20.html) for me, which
we sent out today. We’ll publish the English version in the next days. I think
this could generate some buzz.&#10;

For the next months, I think I’ll spend time improving the app design (although
I’m still not sure what to do with the big blue dots) and marketing it. I’ll set
some goals and make a plan to reach them. One of the things I’d like to achieve
is getting retweeted by Lonely Planet, because I think the app could
particularly appeal to travelers.&#10;

Knowing that a hundred people want to use this app makes me confident that there
is a market. With the limited marketing I did, I don’t think it’s a bad number.
I should at least be able to increase that by 10.&#10;
