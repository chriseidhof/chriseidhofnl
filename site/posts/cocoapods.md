I just upgraded one of my projects to use
[CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods). CocoaPods is a library
dependency manager for XCode projects. You can use it in a way similar to Ruby’s
gems or Haskell’s cabal. The project is just starting, so it’s a little rough,
but it does the job.&#10;

I think this can make code sharing for iOS developers a lot easier. I’m all for
reusing code, but it used to be quite a hassle to include a library, so a lot of
times I would try to avoid reusing other code. I’m pretty sure I’m not the only
developer who’s like this. CocoaPods makes the barrier to reuse a lot
lower.&#10;

By making code sharing a lot easier and encouraging it, I hope that CocoaPods
can change the landscape on iOS. While there are already a lot of open source
components available (for example, on the excellent
[CocoaControls](http://cocoacontrols.com/)), this will hopefully spawn a new
load of open source libraries.&#10;

Cocoa developers, install CocoaPods and give it a try. And while you’re at it,
try to put your favorite library in a Pod file. Together, we can improve the
ecosystem.&#10;
