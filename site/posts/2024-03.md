Last week was really busy, but in a relatively balanced way. We got fresh snow and spent a bunch of time pulling sledges. I also ran every single day of the week, without problems (92km in total). One more week until my 12-week marathon preparation starts. This week I'm hoping to do the same but with a bit more volume. I went to two local meetings (one for the day care and one town-wide gathering). We also went to a demonstration with the whole family yesterday, as I think it's important that we all become a bit more tolerant and open for diversity.

Together with Nicholas (the designer) I made a lot of progress on the new SwiftUI explanations website. I think we're getting to a point where it's almost ready to make it public. My goal is to have this out before the end February. There are still a few design issues that need to be solved and a bunch of content that needs to be written, but it's all really starting to come together now. I hope to make a list of everything that needs to be done before launch within the next few days.

I also started to prepare two in-person workshops in Germany that'll happen within the next months. I'm really looking forward to the in-person part, as it's been quite a while since I last did that.
