title: Plan it the night before
---

About a week ago, I read [this
interview](http://www.startupsopensourced.com/2011/07/28/19-year-old-stanford-ph-d-dropout-andrew-hsu-is-changing-education/%20)
with Andrew Hsu. He said one of his ways to be productive is making your
todo-list the night before. Iâ€™ve tried this for a few days now, and it seems to
work. For the last few day, I really got a lot done.&#10;

One of the reasons why I think it works is because it can help you focus on the
right tasks. Stephen Covey wrote about his [four
quadrants](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FourQuadrants), which can help to classify
your tasks. On one axis, you have important and non-important tasks, on the
other axis there are urgent and non-urgent tasks. We naturally give priority to
urgent tasks, whether they are important or not. What often gets postponed is
the important but non-urgent tasks. *By making your todo-list the night before,
it can help you to focus on the important tasks.*&#10;
