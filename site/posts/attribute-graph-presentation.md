title: "Presentation: Attribute Graph"
headline: A Talk About How (I think) The Attribute Graph Works
---

I gave a talk about my understanding of the Attribute Graph. I created a [presentation page](/presentations/attribute-graph/) that contains the video, an edited transcript and some references.

It was really fun creating the talk: I used my "record typing" tool to automate the typing and animate the graph, preview and other bits. The graphs are draw in SwiftUI, but the layout is done in GraphViz.
