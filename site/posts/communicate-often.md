title: Communicate Often
---

This advice is for freelancers: please communicate as often as possible. When
somebody hires you, they want to know what’s going on. Sometimes you get so
caught up in trying to make a deadline or staying productive, and forget to
communicate. For a client, this can be frustrating, because it looks like
nothing happens (while you were even busier than you would normally be).&#10;

In my opinion, bad communication is one of the hardest problems in technology
(and in life in general). Improving your communication is always a good
thing.&#10;

If I were your client, I would definitely appreciate these things:&#10;

  - Let me know when you know you won’t make the deadline.

  - Ask me if you don’t understand something.

  - If something is a bad idea, please say so. It’s your professional
    responsibility.

  - Send progress reports

  - Let me know when you will contact me again.

  - If you’re too busy to reply, please say so.

  - If you work for a fixed price, but I’m requesting something outside of the
    budget, let me know.

  - If something unexpected happens that will delay things, please let me know.

  - If you need my feedback on something, please make sure I understand it’s a
    question.

  - Send emails that are to the point: explain things in short, understandable
    phrases.

I’ve yet to hire somebody who communicates too often. In true Gruber style, I
wrote this and imagined myself as the audience: my own communication would
improve a lot if I followed the advice in this post.&#10;
