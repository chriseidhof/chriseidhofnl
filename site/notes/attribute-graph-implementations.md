As far as I know, the [Attribute Graph](/note/attribute-graph) is based on [A System for Efficient and Flexible One-Way Constraint Evaluation in C++](https://repository.gatech.edu/entities/publication/50e6cde9-93e5-41f3-8a69-c7557ac58b2e) ([pdf](https://repository.gatech.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/3117139f-5de2-4f1f-9662-8723bae97a6d/content)).

The [OpenSwiftUI Project](https://github.com/OpenSwiftUIProject) has an [OpenGraph](https://github.com/OpenSwiftUIProject/OpenGraph) project. I'm not sure how far along it is.

We reimplemented the Attribute Graph in Swift on [Swift Talk](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E438-attribute-graph-part-10).
