							<p>
								I’ve seen a number of blogposts and talks recently that talk about depression, burn-out, and other mental problems.  One post recommended reading a book. Another one recommended talking to friends and family. These things might help, but I doubt that they actually solve the root cause (looking back, they definitely didn’t solve my problems, at best suppress them).
							</p>
							<p>
								I recommend something different. If you have a mental issue, go see a professional. Take it seriously.  I know there’s a stigma attached to this, let’s try to break through that.
							</p>
							<p>
								If your leg is broken, you’d probably go to the hospital. With mental issues, you often don’t visually see that something is wrong. It might feel harder to justify seeing a professional. Some people are functioning very well while suffering from mental problems. For example, I can often turn my suppressed anger into productivity (alas, the anger still gets suppressed).
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s scary to take that step. I started seeing a therapist about a year and a half ago, to deal with my depression. It’s been one the best things I’ve ever done for myself. If you’re suffering from a mental issue, consider doing the same.
