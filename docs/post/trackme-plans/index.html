							<p>
								Last month, I made € 99.54 from selling <a href="http://eidhof.nl/trackme">TrackMe</a>. The
								first day I sold about 60 copies, and the rest of the sales was spread out over
								the month.

							</p>
							<p>
								The reason why I sold so little is that I didn’t do any marketing. I set up a
								blog for the app, and talked about it on this blog. I announced it on Twitter,
								and wrote a blog post about <a href="http://trackmeapp.tumblr.com/post/9920687010/10-cool-things-you-can-do-with-a-gpx-file">10 cool things you can do with a GPX
									file</a>.
								I would promote it more under my own account, but don’t want to be spammy.

							</p>
							<p>
								Over the last weeks, a friend has written a (Dutch) <a href="http://eidhof.nl/trackme/press/release-2011-09-20.html">press
									release</a> for me, which
								we sent out today. We’ll publish the English version in the next days. I think
								this could generate some buzz.

							</p>
							<p>
								For the next months, I think I’ll spend time improving the app design (although
								I’m still not sure what to do with the big blue dots) and marketing it. I’ll set
								some goals and make a plan to reach them. One of the things I’d like to achieve
								is getting retweeted by Lonely Planet, because I think the app could
								particularly appeal to travelers.

							</p>
							<p>
								Knowing that a hundred people want to use this app makes me confident that there
								is a market. With the limited marketing I did, I don’t think it’s a bad number.
								I should at least be able to increase that by 10.
