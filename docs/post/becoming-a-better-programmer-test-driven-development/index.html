								Becoming a better programmer: Test-Driven Development
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								As I’m enjoying programming again (and more so every week), I started to think
								consciously again about improving myself as a programmer. After a recommendation
								of <a href="http://twitter.com/breun">breun</a> I started reading <a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/academic/product/1,3110,0132350882,00.html">Clean
									Code</a>,
								which I can definitely recommend.

							</p>
							<p>
								One of the things I have always felt bad about professionally is not doing
								Test-Driven Development. Back when I was programming Haskell a lot I did do a
								lot of type-driven development, which overlaps a bit: you write down your types
								and then try to implement it. However, in Objective-C the type system isn’t of
								much use (compared to Haskell), so I really had to do it: write tests.

							</p>
							<p>
								Another really big motivation is that I took over a project from another
								developer. The project was huge, and there were no tests at all. I ended up
								breaking things multiple times without realizing it (and I only found out after
								deploying it to the testers). I pledged to myself to do better than that.

							</p>
							<p>
								Before I set off to write some tests, I had to find a testing framework. There
								is a great community wiki on StackOverflow called <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114083/ios-tests-specs-tdd-bdd-and-integration-acceptance-testing">iOS Tests/Specs TDD/BDD and
									Integration &amp; Acceptance
									Testing</a>,
								but it’s also a bit overwhelming.

							</p>
							<p>
								I started out by using the built-in Unit Testing framework that’s provided by
								Apple (see: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/UnitTesting/">XCode Unit Testing
									Guide</a>).
								However, writing unit tests is quite hard for GUI code. As I wanted to test a
								new UIView subclass that I was developing, I had to test things such as tapping
								and inspecting other views.

							</p>
							<p>
								Then I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/square/KIF">KIF</a> (again, after a
								recommendation from breun), an open source integration testing framework by
								Square. As advertised, it was easy to configure and set up, and I was writing
								tests very soon after that. For example, here’s a scenario that tests whether my
								view closes, and even when you haven’t used KIF before you can understand
								exactly what it does:

							</p>
							<pre><code>KIFTestScenario *scenario = [KIFTestScenario scenarioWithDescription:@&quot;Test that the picker closes when tapped outside&quot;];

[scenario addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToReset]];
[scenario addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToAppear]];
[scenario addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToWaitForViewWithAccessibilityLabel:pickerAccessibilityLabel]];
[scenario addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToTapViewWithAccessibilityLabel:@&quot;Tap to close&quot;]];
[scenario addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToWaitForAbsenceOfViewWithAccessibilityLabel:pickerAccessibilityLabel]];
</code></pre>
							<p>
								So far, I’m quite happy with the combination of KIF and the built-in unit
								testing. I’ll try to apply it to more of my projects, and probably be a better
								programmer because of that. At least when other people will read my code they
								can use the tests as documentation to see what the code should do.
