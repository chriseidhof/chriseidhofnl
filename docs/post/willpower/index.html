							<p>
								I hate flossing. My dentist insists that I do it, and after each visit I
								promised to do better next time, but never followed through. I wanted to, but I
								lacked the discipline to do it.

							</p>
							<p>
								Some two months ago, I decided to do it differently. Instead of using my
								willpower, I tricked myself into creating a habit. I grabbed a big piece of
								paper, made rows and columns, creating about 60 large squares.

							</p>
							<p>
								Each day, after flossing, I would draw something in the square. At the
								beginning, it was just a cross. But my drawings became much more advanced, and
								something to look forward to. After 3 days, it was already hard to break the
								pattern, even though I still hated flossing.

							</p>
							<p>
								This week I’m traveling, and I didn’t bring my piece of paper (which is
								completely filled, anyway). However, I did bring my dental floss, and just
								yesterday I noticed it has become a complete habit. I don’t think about it
								anymore, except when I forget it. Then I still do it.

							</p>
							<p>
								I didn’t think of this trick myself, by the way. I once read about it on
								Lifehacker, as it’s also know as <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">Seinfeld’s Productivity
									Secret</a>. Over
								the next months, I’ll probably reuse it for other habits I’d like to
								instill.
