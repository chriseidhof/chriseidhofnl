								Last week we prepared and recorded <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E369-cubic-bezier-keyframes-part-1">more episodes</a> about our SwiftUI keyframe reimplementation effort. I also worked on getting closer to the Catmull-Rom version that SwiftUI has implemented, but I’m not quite there yet. It’s close enough to be unnoticable, but I always feel like pushing that extra bit to get 100% accurate is somehow worth it when trying to understand how things work.

								We replaced our old blender at home (it broke over a year ago), so I’ve been on a bit of a smoothie trip, making all kinds of combinations (spinach/banana/ginger is one of my favorites). I also finally made gazpacho again: almost everything (except for the stale bread) came directly from the garden. Absolutely delicious.
							</p>
							<p>
								Towards the end of the week we started integrating the iOS 17 chapter of Thinking in SwiftUI into the rest of the book. This was a bit more work than expected but we have the basic contents in. Now some parts don’t flow as nicely, so that’ll be our focus for this week.

								Yesterday I ran a 24km race again on quite difficult terrain. I wasn’t really sure how fit I am, but it turned to be much better than expected. I started off quickly and built up a gap to the guy behind me. I was afraid I overpaced myself doing that, and the gap stayed at roughly the same distance. Towards the end there was a short but steep climb where he got much closer, but I still had enough left to not let him pass.
