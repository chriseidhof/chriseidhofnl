								Going to <a href="http://pragmamark.org">pragma</a> was awesome as always. We went with the whole family and took so many trains! (I even got a status upgrade by Deutsche Bahn and am now a gold member.)
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										Fürstenberg → Berlin
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Berlin → München
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										München → Kufstein
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Kufstein → Innsbruck
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								We then stayed in Innsbruck for two nights, and went on to Verona by taking two more trains:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										Innsbrück → Brenner
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Brenner → Verona
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								After a night in Verona, we took a train straight to Bologna and a bus to top it off. The kids also really enjoyed all the travel. We did a reasonable job with packing, but should probably have packed lighter still. Our way back from Bologna was much easier: it only took us one train to get to Munich, and two more trains the next day to get home. We would definitely do something like this again.
							</p>
							<p>
								I managed to implement a very basic version of the attribute graph based on <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=9609985dbef43633f4deb88c949a9776e0cd766b">this paper</a>. It seems to work for basic stuff, but I’m not 100% sure yet how to do all the SwiftUI-specific things. For example, how does layout work? The parent proposes a size, so the child is dependent on that. Yet the child may at a later point change its state and the parent needs to relayout.
							</p>
							<p>
								My talk at Pragma went well. I had my talk ready a few weeks before the conference, yet like to practice a lot in the days before the actual talk. Due to the kids and traveling, I was only able to go through my talk twice in the final week, but it still went okay. In general, there were a lot of great talks and conversations at the conference.

								For most things I have been using <a href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj">jj</a> instead of git as my daily driver. It works surprisingly well. In my career I’ve used CVS, SVN and git. Each always felt like a big step forward and somehow made the previous tool feel old and outdated. jj has a similar effect for me.
