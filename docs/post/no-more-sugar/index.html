								30 day experiment: no more sugar
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								Ever since I heard about <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/30-days-to-success/">30 day
									challenges</a>,
								I have loved the idea. About 6 weeks ago, it was time for a new 30 day
								challenge: cutting out sugar. I have been a sugar addict for a long time: I can
								always eat sugary stuff and have a constant craving. I thought that this would
								be the hardest thing I had ever done (and I’ve done things like running a half
								marathon). The experiment was more an experiment in self-control than an
								experiment to stay healthy (I have a pretty good bodyweight because I run a
								lot).

							</p>
							<p>
								On my list of things not to eat was candy, crisps, cookies, ice cream, etcetera.
								I didn’t want to drink normal sodas either (diet sodas, however, were allowed).
								When heaving breakfast, lunch or dinner the cooks oftentimes put sugar in your
								meals, I didn’t care about that. As long as I could stick to three regular meals
								a day, nothing in between and no desserts I would be happy. There was one big
								exception: after running I allowed myself to drink chocolate milk, which is a<a href="http://www.acsm.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=About_ACSM&TEMPLATE=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&CONTENTID=14752">really good recovery
									drink</a>,
								high on both carbs and proteins. The day before the experiment, I had a lot of
								sugar: chocolate, ice cream, sodas and more.

							</p>
							<p>
								When the experiment started, I immediately noticed how it wasn’t as hard as
								expected. After about a week, it didn’t seem hard at all. I noticed how I had
								all these habits involving sugar (the candy that comes with the bill, a coke
								during dinner, bringing a bag of candy on a long train ride, downing a box of
								orange tic-tacs). Before, I wasn’t aware of all these habits, but the experiment
								made me notice. I also started noticing how <em>my happiness level during the day
									was more equal</em>
								. No more sugar crashes, which made me feel quite stable.

							</p>
							<p>
								At the end of the experiment, I noticed how I actually liked it. I wasn’t
								thinking anymore about the next opportunity to get some chocolate, it felt very
								natural. The first day after the experiment I again bought a big supply of
								sugary things and ate it all, and to be honest: I didn’t really like it. I can
								still enjoy a piece of chocolate every now and then, but I don’t like it as much
								as I used to. At the moment of writing, I’ve decided to repeat the experiment
								again (but only for two weeks), just because it felt so good. <em>It’s a lot easier
									not to eat any sugar at all than to eat a little bit.</em>
