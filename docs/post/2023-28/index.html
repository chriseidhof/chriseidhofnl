								Bezier Curves

								Last week we put the finishing touches to the animation chapter, and recorded a bunch of episodes to cover the summer break. I worked a bit on my talk as well.
							</p>
							<p>
								For our keyframe reimplementation, we also wanted to have cubic bezier timing curves. This was interesting to implement: sampling a cubic bezier curve is actually really simple, I was basically able to take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bézier_curve#Cubic_Bézier_curves">Wikipedia’s algorithm</a> and just write it down in Swift. The algorithm is a function from <code>t</code> to a point (you can actually use <code>VectorArithmetic</code> instead of a point, which I did). After plotting everything, I realized that the <code>t</code> isn’t used as the time value. Instead, if you use a <code>CGPoint</code>, the <code>x</code> value is the time, and the <code>y</code> value the progress. in other words, the <code>t</code> is used to sample the result, but not as the time or value.
							</p>
							<p>
								This makes a lot of sense, but took me a while to figure out. To provide an efficient implementation, we need to then first find a <code>t</code> for a given time (in other words, find <code>t</code> for <code>x</code>). There seem to be a number of efficient ways to do this <a href="https://github.com/gre/bezier-easing/tree/master">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/Source/WebCore/platform/graphics/UnitBezier.h">this</a> seems to be helpful. Once we have the correct <code>t</code> we can get <code>y</code> as well.
							</p>
							<p>
								When you have multiple cubic bezier keyframes after each other, the implementation uses Catmull-Rom to interpolate between the keyframes. I also managed to implement this (on top of quadratic bezier curves), getting the exact same timing curve. Hopefully we can get this to Swift Talk sometime soon!
							</p>

								The summer holiday has started here, we had family visiting and will be going on a trip of our own. So next week there almost certainly won’t be any weeknotes.
