							<p>
								While I was traveling last month, I met a lot of great people. One of them was
								a 73-year old woman who had been very successful in her life. She was a
								professor at a well-known university in the USA and has now retired to Spain.
								She is still doing amazing things.

							</p>
							<p>
								I asked her: “What’s your secret to success, apart from working hard and being
								intelligent?”. She said: “Nothing, just that”.

							</p>
							<p>
								Then I wanted to know if she had ever felt burned out, or felt like quitting.
								She answered: “Yes. The first time it’s very scary. However, every time this
								happened I had reached some kind of plateau, and it was time to take the next
								step. Each time, I just waited it out and grew. The next times, I started to
								recognize it when it happened and slowly advanced to the next level in my
								career.”
