								Lighter UIViewControllers
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								Recently, I’ve been a bit obsessed with writing simpler code. It happened
								
								because I passed on some projects to other programmers. I would like to feel
								
								minimally embarrassed when doing so.

							</p>
							<p>
								In the projects I’ve taken over from other people, one of the most common
								
								problems is that view controller code is big and complicated. In this article,
								
								we’ll look at some ways to make the view controller smaller and thus simpler. In
								
								a project I’m working on currently, we have about 150 classes, and almost none
								
								of them is larger than 100 lines. The ones that are larger than that are on the
								
								top of my refactoring list.

							</p>
							<h1>
								Separate out UITableViewDataSource and UITableViewDelegate

							</h1>
							<p>
								One of the first things I often do is create a separate class for the
								
								tableView’s data source and delegate. Just create a new class, take all the
								
								methods that start with <code>tableView:</code> and put them in there. The compiler will
								
								then show you which things are missing in that class (e.g. instance variables),
								
								and you pass them on. Then you can remove them from the view controller.

							</p>
							<h1>
								Don’t do domain logic

							</h1>
							<p>
								Most of my apps are backed by a Core Data stack (but this is true for any kind
								
								of data store). I Try to do as little domain logic as possible. For Core Data,
								
								my favorite trick is to add a category to the generated models where I put my
								
								logic. For example, instead of doing this in your view controller:

							</p>
							<pre><code class>- (Department*)getRootDepartment:(Department*)department {
  if(department.parent == nil) return department;
  return [self getRootDepartment:department.parent];
}
</code></pre>
							<p>
								Do this in <code>Department+Extensions.m</code>:

							</p>
							<pre><code class>- (Department*)rootDepartment {
  if(self.parent == nil) return self;
  return [self rootDepartment];
}
</code></pre>
							<p>
								Even for small methods like this, it helps a lot to keep your view controllers
								
								small. You also have the added benefit that it’s much easier to reuse this
								
								code.

							</p>
							<h1>
								Don’t do webservice logic

							</h1>
							<p>
								Don’t call and parse a webservice request in your view controller.

							</p>
							<p>
								I always create a separate set of classes that do the dealing with webservices.
								
								It depends how complicated your webservice / persistency is, but I mostly have a
								
								class called <code>Webservice</code> that gives you high-level methods to call the
								
								webservice. Either the methods accept callbacks or I use KVO (more about that
								
								later). It uses the “fire and forget” approach: you tell the webservice that you
								
								want something and then forget, assume it will get back to you at some
								
								point.

							</p>
							<p>
								The webservice class calls the API and turns the API results into domain
								
								objects. This functionality is often achieved by multiple classes that are used
								
								by the webservice, but that’s a topic for a later post.

							</p>
							<h1>
								Don’t create complicated view hierarchies

							</h1>
							<p>
								Don’t set up complicated view hierarchies in your view controller. Personally,
								
								I’m a big fan of designing my views in a nib/xib/storyboard. But even if you
								
								don’t, I think it’s better to compose several views into a new view. For
								
								example, if you want a date slider, it’s better to create the view hierarchy for
								
								that (the labels at the axes, a label representing the current date and the
								
								UISlider) in a separate class.

							</p>
							<h1>
								Create child view controllers

							</h1>
							<p>
								Since iOS 5, it’s very easy to create child view controllers. Use this
								
								functionality. It makes your life easier. This is mostly useful for iPad apps,
								
								but might be useful for iPhone apps as well. A classical example of this is the
								
								split view, but in any screen where you have components that are almost
								
								independent it might be useful.

							</p>
							<h1>
								Use KVO

							</h1>
							<p>
								Key value observing can make your life a lot easier. It’s also a bit tricky
								
								sometimes, so you do need to spend some time to learn it, and you will probably
								
								make some mistakes (I still get tripped up every now and then).

							</p>
							<p>
								One example where KVO really shines is the <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code>. It
								
								listens to changes in core data objects and can be used to implement a
								<code>UITableViewDataSource</code> or <code>UICollectionViewDataSource</code>.

							</p>
							<p>
								For example, suppose you have a list of <code>Departments</code>. Then you want to refresh
								
								that list from the API. In your view controller, you fire a off a request like
								<code>[webservice reloadDepartments]</code> and then forget. Once the webservice updates
								
								the Core Data managed objects, magic happens: Because you implemented your
								<code>UITableViewDataSource</code> using an <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code>, it gets refreshed
								
								automatically.

							</p>
							<p>
								KVO by itself can be a bit hairy sometimes, and there are small libraries like
								<a href="https://github.com/th-in-gs/THObserversAndBinders" title>THObserversAndBinders</a> that
								
								make things easier.

							</p>
							<h1>
								Other ideas?

							</h1>
							<p>
								This is just a list of things that I could come up with and common refactorings
								
								I use. I’m sure there are a lot of things I forgot, let me know your tips and
								
								I’ll add them to the article.
