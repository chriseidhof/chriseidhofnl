								Niche and Top Lists apps
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								At yesterday’s CocoaHeads meetup, I was discussing with Ben the marketing
								strategy for his app, <a href="http://boonbits.com/captio/">Captio</a>. It is aimed at
								people who want to capture their notes quickly: as soon as you open the app, it
								shows an input field, end when you press <em>Send</em>
								 the note is emailed to yourself.
								It’s been my favorite app for a long time.

							</p>
							<p>
								The problem with Captio is that it is mostly useful for a niche group: people
								who capture their ideas a lot. Ben asked me if I know ways of getting more
								customers. I told him his target audience needs to read about it, for example on
								lifehacking and Getting Things Done sites. He told me they already do.

							</p>
							<p>
								So this is when I realized again the clear difference between apps: your apps
								are either a niche or a top-lists app. If you build a niche app, you have to be
								findable. Make sure your audience reads about you in their favorite publications
								(whether it’s online or offline), and make sure they can find you in the App
								Store.

							</p>
							<p>
								If you build a top-lists app, make sure you get to the top lists. Your audience
								is going to be very big, and it’s going to be hard to market them. To do this,
								your app needs to be extremely awesome or you need to be very good at marketing
								(or both).

							</p>
							<p>
								I don’t think there’s much in between these two categories. Sure, those apps
								exist, but they probably don’t sell a lot. So with every app your making, ask
								yourself the question: is it going to be niche and findable, or am I planning to
								win the lottery?
