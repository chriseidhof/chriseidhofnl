								On Running

							<p>
								Running gives me a lot of energy. After a run, there is the runner’s high: the
								
								released endorphin in my brain makes me feel great.

							</p>
							<p>
								Training, races and continually wanting to get better makes me push myself. I’m
								
								not pushing too much, for risk of over-training, but I am constantly overcoming
								
								barriers and improving. After running my first half marathon a few years ago, I
								
								felt on top of the world, and that feeling lasted an entire week. The
								
								achievement made everything else in life seem so easy in comparison.

							</p>
							<p>
								Running keeps my body fit, which helps for my mind too. I feel happier and more
								
								creative. Some therapists prescribe running to depressed people, as it can
								
								relieve stress and anxiety.

							</p>
							<p>
								Being an avid runner, I also like to watch other runners. Seeing people break
								
								world records or their own personal best is very inspiring. Watching a 73-year
								
								old man run 160 kilometers (100 miles) through the mountains is even better.
								
								Being a runner myself makes me appreciate these things even more.

							</p>
							<p>
								Running also brings me discipline. I have carried that discipline into other
								
								areas of my life as well. It takes a bit to get started with running, but once
								
								you are going out on a regular schedule, you feel more disciplined and better
								
								about yourself. Enjoy!
