							<p>
								Today I spent a lot of time implementing landscape orientation, next to portrait
								orientation (as this gives you a bigger keyboard). However, in the end I managed
								to nail it, I think. Everything resizes, moves around and plays nice with
								showing and hiding the keyboard.

							</p>
							<p>
								I also added hover effects for the passcode buttons, designed the section
								header, changed the passcode screen slightly, added swipe to delete and changed
								the selection color of the text. Also, you can now go to the contact’s details
								from the meetup details screen. Thanks to Eelco and Martijn for pointing out
								some of these bugs and issues.

							</p>
							<p><a href="http://schwuk.com/">Dave Murphy</a> wrote in to ask why I designed a splash screen
								instead of showing an empty UI (the last is recommended by Apple). As I expect
								most users to secure their app with a passcode, the splash screen is the
								background for the passcode screen as well. When you start the app, the passcode
								keyboard will slide in. Although Dave might be right, I think I’ll leave it like
								this for now.

							</p>
							<p>
								He also asked if I considered the icon with just the ‘m’, and I haven’t. I’ll
								experiment with that tomorrow!

							</p>
							<p>
								I won’t release another beta today, as I want to fix some outstanding bugs
								tomorrow, but the beta testers can expect a new version at the end of the
								afternoon (in Europe).
