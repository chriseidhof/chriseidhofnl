								Burnout: five years later

								What happened in between getting a burnout and being happy again

							<p>
								About five years ago, I had a burnout. Or at least, something very similar to it. I had no joy programming anymore, <em>especially</em> programming for iOS. I wrote some stream-of-consciousness <a href="/post/how-i-got-a-burnout" title>posts</a> about it. Now, five years later, I&apos;m a very happy programmer again. I&apos;m writing this to figure out what happened in between.
							</p>
							<p>
								When I realized things weren&apos;t going to well with me, the first thing that I did is taking a few months off. I hardly did any programming. In fact, I hardly did anything at all. I did start taking running a bit more serious, and really tried to put some effort into that. I believe the running was a big factor in helping me through the burnout, both because it helps against depression and it made me feel good about myself. Even at the moment I&apos;m writing this, I have just put in a hard run and am still high on the endorphins.
							</p>
							<p>
								I started thinking really hard about other ways to make a living, but couldn&apos;t really figure out what I wanted. I did not get excited at all about any technology-related stuff. The &quot;best&quot; idea was to start a trail running company that organizes trips to mountainous areas for people who live in flat places. I moved to Berlin. I had some small iOS gigs going on to pay the bills, but I wasn&apos;t too happy (although I was happier than in the beginning). Then, at some point, I decided I needed to take on some bigger gigs to make sure I could keep paying the bills, and started doing lots of things. I got busy, and at some point started working with <a href="https://twitter.com/floriankugler" title>Florian</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Working with him made things really fun again, for many different reasons. We had a challenging project and took the time to do things right. He was inexperienced on the iOS platform, but really challenged lots of my habits, and I learned a lot. At the same time, I started organizing the first edition of <a href="http://www.uikonf.com" title>UIKonf</a>. Doing all these things was just so much fun. It did &quot;feel like work&quot; sometimes, but because of the results we were getting, it was awesome.
							</p>
							<p>
								Around the same time, I started objc.io, together with Florian and <a href="https://twitter.com/danielboedewadt" title>Daniel</a>. I already knew working with Florian was awesome. Working with Daniel was just as awesome, but for different reasons. He is both really smart and has <em>a lot</em> of experience. It is so nice writing things and having Daniel say: &quot;well, actually...&quot; and learning so much from his explanations. He often solves problems in a very elegant way that is obvious to understand, but not so easy to come up with. Learning all this stuff made programming a lot of fun again.
							</p>
							<p>
								Looking back, I think I might have <a href="/post/reaching-a-plateau" title>reached a plateau</a> when I got the burnout. Taking a long break and having a new hobby was really good. After that, learning lots of new things and accepting that I hardly knew anything really made me excited about programming again. Finally, a major part is other people: working together with people who challenge you is really great. If you&apos;re struggling with similar problems: it took me a few years, but this is what worked for me.
