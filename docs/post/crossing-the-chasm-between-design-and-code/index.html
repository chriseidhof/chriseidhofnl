								Recently there was an <a href="http://flyosity.com/application-design/if-you-can-think-design-code-you-win.php">excellent post by Mike
									Rundle</a>about how one person can be a designer and programmer at once.

							</p>
							<p>
								I think having a designer and programmer in the same person is a great idea. I
								wish I would be better at design (not only do I lack experience, I’m also not
								sure if I would have the patience to become a good designer).

							</p>
							<p>
								When I’ve worked with designers before, I sometimes noticed that they would just
								give me a design to implement, which I did. If something didn’t work on the
								iPhone (for example, creating an endless navigation structure) I would report
								back.

							</p>
							<p>
								There is a problem with this: often times, there is a gap between the knowledge
								of the designer and the programmer. The designer doesn’t always know what’s
								technically possible, what’s simple or what’s a good idea. On the other side, a
								programmer often doesn’t know what makes good design.

							</p>
							<p>
								I think the best teams are with people who have an <em>overlap</em>
								, instead of a gap.
								For example, if a designer knows how to program, they know the kind of things
								that are possible. Also, programmers need to know more about design.

							</p>
							<p>
								One good example of where this is done is the <a href="http://functionsource.com/post/beautiful-forms">Square credit card
									field</a>, which is not just design
								or programming, but really achieves synergy by combining them.

							</p>
							<p>
								Another thing is animations: a lot of designers aren’t used to this yet, mostly
								designing interfaces that don’t animate. Programmers often don’t know when it’s
								useful or meaningful to do an animation. They just want the button to do what
								it’s supposed to do. If we both move a bit closer towards each other, I
								imagine it could improve software a lot.

							</p>
							<p>
								To come back to Mike’s article, when one person knows how to design and code,
								there is no gap between that knowledge. A very powerful combination indeed.
