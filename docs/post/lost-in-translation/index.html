								One of the hardest part in software development is communication. I don’t mean
								
								network communication, but person-to-person communication. This is one reason
								
								why it’s so convenient to work alone on your pet projects: you don’t have to
								
								communicate at all.

							</p>
							<p>
								Every time you communicate, there is noise in the signal. Because both parties
								
								have different backgrounds, you lose part of the message whenever you talk to
								
								somebody else. In general, the more similar the backgounds (e.g. two programmers
								
								talking to each other), the smaller the error rate.

							</p>
							<p>
								It is extremely important to realize this, especially when talking to people
								
								outside of your occupation. On of the best examples I’ve seen was by <a href="http://sam.aaron.name/" title>Sam
									
									Aaron</a>. A few years ago, he showed me a DSL he
								
								implemented in Ruby to encode his clients’ logic. In true DSL fashion, his
								
								language exactly described their problem domain, and his program exactly
								
								specified the way he solved their problems.

							</p>
							<p>
								Together with the client, Sam sat down and looked at the code. The client wasn’t
								
								able to program at all, but was able to read what Sam wrote. Together, they did
								
								some pair-programming to fix the logical errors that got lost during
								
								communication. This is a prime example of domain specific languages, and one of
								
								the best examples of clear communication in software I’ve seen so far.
