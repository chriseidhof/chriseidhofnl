								Sketches and ideas

							<p>
								Although I was traveling yesterday, I sketched some small mockups for the
								
								Contacts app. The idea for the app had come when the genius Lucas Tieleman
								
								explained to me how he keeps a small book with notes about everyone. Yesterday
								
								he sent an email with the notes he had about me: it’s fun and only freaked me
								
								out a little bit (not as much as I expected). He’s a very early adopter of new
								
								technology, and he wanted this on his iPhone.

							</p>
							<p>
								One of the things he suggested was adding a game element. I’m not sure if that’s
								
								a good idea: although it would be fun at first, I think game elements get
								
								annoying later. One “game-ish” option would be to have a calendar view showing
								
								how many notes you made that day, and when you see it you will want to have at
								
								least one note a day (hopefully).

							</p>
							<p><a href="http://tupil.com" title>Eelco</a> also pointed out <a href="http://with.me/" title>With</a> by Path. Just
								
								like <a href="http://hashable.com/beta" title>Hashable</a>: while there is great inspiration in
								
								there, I think they both focus way too much on social networks and sharing.
								
								Especially for the purpose I had in mind (taking notes about people) this is
								
								scary. As Lucas also noted: some if this stuff is really private.

							</p>
							<p>
								Today I’ll probably start a new XCode project and quickly implement an app
								
								that’s usable for me, and iterate upon that. For now, here’s two of the
								
								sketches I made yesterday (although they are already outdated):
