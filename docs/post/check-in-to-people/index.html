								Check In to People
							</h1>

						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								As I wrote in <a href="/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff">yesterday’s
									post</a>, I’m going to build an
								app in four weeks. Now I’ve chosen the idea that I’m going to build: check in to
								people. This will give you an archive of when you met people. After you check
								in, you can add notes and maybe pictures.

							</p>
							<p>
								Yesterday I’ve thought about the next steps and about the minimum viable
								product, and researched existing apps.

							</p>
							<p><em>Existing Software</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								It looks like there is one app that does something similar, it’s called<a href="http://www.fellowup.com/">FellowUp</a>. However, it doesn’t include the time
								aspect as much as I want to.

							</p>
							<p>
								I also stumbled on a blog post by Loic Le Meur, founder of Seesmic and
								LeWeb.net, who describes a <a href="http://loiclemeur.com/english/2011/03/its-time-for-personal-asshole-proof-crm.html">Personal
									CRM</a>system. This is some nice validation. People like Loic are my potential
								market.

							</p>
							<p><em>MVP</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								The Minimum Viable Product is an app with two features: check in and review. If
								you press “Check In”, you can choose a person from your Address Book (or add
								somebody). Then you can choose the date and time (which is pre-set to the
								current date and time). You can add notes directly, or later on.

							</p>
							<p>
								If you press “People”, you get a list of your contacts. You can browse them
								alphabetically, and selecting a contact gives you the full history of your
								check-ins with that person.

							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, if you press “Archive” you get a list of your check-ins, sorted by
								date. For example, if you use Getting Things Done you can use it for your weekly
								reviews.

							</p>
							<p>
								There are a <em>lot</em>
								 of other features I thought of, but this will be the MVP.

							</p>
							<p><em>Business Model</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								I can see two straightforward options for the business model: a free app that
								allows you to purchase extra features or a paid app. A third option would be to
								have a subscription service, but I think that should only be done if there is a
								server component included (for example, a plugin in GMail). I have to think of a
								good price. Because it’s a niche app, it won’t be 99 cents, but probably
								something like $4.99. Any tips on the pricing would be much appreciated.

							</p>
							<p><em>Next Steps</em>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										Start drawing prototypes
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Think about who my market is, exactly, and how to market it to them
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Think about the branding of the app (name, visual design, icon)
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Build a working prototype
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								As always, the marketing will be the most difficult for me. I’ll have to think
								hard about that.

							</p>
							<p><em>Update</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								Right after publishing this post, I found out about<a href="http://hashable.com/">Hashable</a>. It’s a very similar tool, however, it’s a
								service that requires you to login, and it’s social (you can share things with
								people). I envisioned a product where everything stays on your iPhone. I’ll have
								to think if this is a good reason to quit the project or if it’s the perfect
								validation.
