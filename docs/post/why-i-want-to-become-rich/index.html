							<p>
								My ambition is to become a millionaire by the time I’m 30 years old. That gives
								me about 3.5 more years to accomplish that goal. Even though I’m really happy
								where I am now and have enough money to live off, I still aim for bigger
								things.

							</p>
							<p>
								The reason is not that I want to have more expensive houses or more stuff. I’m
								not a sucker for luxury (yet?).  In fact, I’ve been reducing the amount of stuff
								I own considerably, living out of a suitcase and planning to live out of a
								backpack. I canceled my apartment too, and don’t own a car or other things. I’m
								not planning to become rich so I never have to work anymore either, because I
								love building new stuff and creating value.

							</p>
							<p>
								For me, the reason why I want to be rich is to have even more freedom. I would
								like to take on bigger projects. I’m now at the point where I can comfortably
								take care of myself, but it would be awesome to be able to hire other people. I
								don’t have enough money yet to work on projects that take years before they
								become profitable, but do have some big ideas with those constraints.

							</p>
							<p>
								This is my reason. Why are you trying to become rich? Or why not?
