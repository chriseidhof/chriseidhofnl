								Met has launched
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								Today is the official release of <a href="http://met.io/">Met</a>. I will send out a press
								release to all the Dutch iOS websites, and will send out an press release in
								English tomorrow. The last few weeks have been quite an adventure. I documented
								all the steps of building Met on this weblog, starting with choosing an idea and
								ending with submitting it to the App Store.

							</p>
							<p>
								For those that haven’t read the story yet: Met is an application that allows you
								to take notes on people. If you meet a lot of people, it can be easy to forget
								important things about them. By writing done some quick notes after a meeting
								you can remember those details.

							</p>
							<p>
								Here’s a quick summary of the last few weeks:

							</p>
							<p><strong>Week 1</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I started with a blog post explain the <a href="/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff">three different app
									ideas</a> I considered for this
								project. I then <a href="/post/check-in-to-people">chose the idea for Met</a>,
								and designed a MVP, based on all the comments I got from people. The next day, I<a href="/post/sketches-and-ideas">sketched some ideas</a> and wrote up my
								thoughts at the <a href="/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-week-1">end of week 1</a>,
								and also included some first screenshots (man, that looks so different from the
								current state Met is in).

							</p>
							<p><strong>Week 2</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								At the <a href="/post/start-of-week-2">start of week 2</a>, I did some code
								cleanup, and tried to define the next steps: get the basic functionality done
								and thought of <a href="/post/selecting-people-faster">a better way to select
									people</a> (which is an action you
								perform a lot, so it has to be fast).

							</p>
							<p>
								The <a href="/post/start-of-week-2">end of week 2</a> was strange: working on
								other projects, not feeling productive, thinking and designing. After a day of
								designing, I threw all the designs away and stayed with Apple’s default
								design.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Week 3</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Week 3 started with releasing a beta version and <a href="/post/beta-and-branding">thinking about the
									branding</a>. After reading that post,
								Jurriaan sent me <a href="/post/introducing-met">an awesome name
									suggestion</a>. I defined the next actions and
								set to work. I implement <a href="/post/rotation-fun">support for device
									rotations</a>, which is essential for fast typing
								(as the landscape layout gives you a bigger keyboard). I posted <a href="/post/new-build-and-screenshots">some
									screenshots</a> and wrote about <a href="/post/week-3-an-app-in-four-weeks">my
									experiences so far</a>.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Week 4</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								The last week was a bit chaotic, as I was doing some personal projects. I did<a href="/post/how-i-will-design-my-app-website">research on app websites</a>,
								and picked a few I really liked. I tried to identify the important things they
								have in common. I wrote about my <a href="/post/new-build-first-website-press-plans">press
									plans</a> and finally<a href="/post/met-in-the-app-store">submitted</a> Met to the App Store

							</p>
							<p><strong>Closing thoughts</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								My goal was to help other people by documenting the process of building an app.
								Additionally, I expected to get some attention by doing it, which would
								hopefully increase sales a bit. However, I didn’t expect that people would be so
								helpful, giving me lots of suggestions, ideas and tips. Just awesome.

							</p>
							<p>
								Half of the beta testers gave me really useful comments. This helped improve the
								app a lot. The other half said “I guess it’s not for me”, which is only
								fair.

							</p>
							<p>
								I am really excited to see how the launch goes. I’m a bit afraid that I might
								have built something that nobody wants to use, but on the other hand: I use Met
								myself, daily, and I really like it. It’s already proven to be very
								useful!

							</p>
							<p>
								If you want to use Met yourself, please <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/met-take-notes-about-the-people/id476264034?ls=1&mt=8">buy it in the App
									Store</a>.
