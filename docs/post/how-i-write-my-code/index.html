								How I write my code
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								Recently I saw a couple of posts on how people write their code. I found it
								inspiring, and part of the reason I’m writing this article is that I don’t know
								how I write my code (not explicitly, at least).

							</p>
							<p>
								Most of the time, I know what I’m going to build a few days, weeks or even
								months beforehand. During the time between idea and building, I think about it.
								I don’t set apart time to do that, it just happens. If the problem is
								interesting, I’ll think more about it than a problem with a straightforward
								solution.

							</p>
							<p>
								Once I start coding, most of the times I start with the hardest problem. For
								example, if I would build a Google Maps like application I would start by
								implementing the map view and the tiles. Later on, I will add the more “boring”
								parts. The upside of this approach: you will discover the hard problems early on
								in the process. The downside: you sometimes have to push yourself to finish all
								the little details. Sometimes I lose interest in the last part of the
								process.

							</p>
							<p>
								During the coding, I’m logging a lot. I’m a big logger. I love NSLog,
								console.log, println and their friends. I once heard that there are two cults of
								programmers: those who log, and those who use breakpoints. I hardly ever use
								breakpoints, although sometimes they can be handy.

							</p>
							<p>
								I always put my projects under version control, but in the beginning of the
								project I don’t write any useful commit messages. Lots of commits are named
								“checkpoint”. When collaborating or working on a larger project I do make sure
								my commits are logical and have a good commit message.

							</p>
							<p>
								I almost never write tests. I think this is one of my major professional
								weaknesses. This also has to do with the fact that I’ve programmed Haskell a
								lot, where you don’t need much testing, as you can use the type system to do
								testing. Maybe it would be a good new year’s resolution: write more tests.

							</p>
							<p>
								I sparsely document my code. I try make sure it is very readable. For example,
								when writing a complex if condition, you can add some documentation to explain
								what it does. Instead, I will pull it out into a variable and name it
								appropriately. I also use method names that describe what they are doing.

							</p>
							<p>
								When I’m quickly building something, I sometimes copy/paste code, but always put
								a comment: “copy pasted from [filename]”. This way I can continue my train of
								thought. However, it hurts me to see this, so when I’m refactoring I try to
								simplify it. I can’t stand repetitive code, and will work hard to eliminate it
								and solve things in a beautiful way.
