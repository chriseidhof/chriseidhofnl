								On Breakups
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								Not too long ago, I went through a breakup, or to put it another way: I got
								dumped. Fortunately, this wasn’t the first time I went through a breakup.
								Everybody handles it differently, but these are the sort of things that help me
								deal with it:

							</p>
							<p>
								I meet a lot of friends and talk about it. I go out to bars where nice girls
								hang out, just to reassure myself that there are more girls out there. I try to
								sleep a lot, eat healthy, exercise: take good care of myself. I change something
								in my life, sometimes radical, sometimes not so radical. Make some new
								friends.

							</p>
							<p>
								I never come back together, and don’t even consider the possibility. This makes
								letting go easier. Until I’m completely over it, and longer, I try to minimize
								the contact. I accept the situation, no matter what the reasons for the breakup
								are. Even if I don’t know the reasons.

							</p>
							<p>
								After living together, moving out of the place makes it easier. Otherwise I’ll
								keep hoping she might be there when I hear a noise or get home.

							</p>
							<p>
								Breakups suck for the most part, but there are upsides too: I have a lot more
								free time. I can do whatever I want to, no concessions. I will fall in love
								again. And perhaps the biggest, most immediate upside: I’m reminded once again
								that I’ve got awesome friends and family (thanks guys!).

							</p>
