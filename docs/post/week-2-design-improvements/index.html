								Week 2: design improvements

							<p>
								This post is about Week 2 of my <a href="/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff">One App in Four
									Weeks</a> project.

							</p>
							<p>
								This week was a bit strange, in many ways. For me, it didn’t feel like a
								productive week. On Monday and Tuesday I got some things done, Wednesday I was
								travelling (but thinking) and Thursday I spent most of the day creating a custom
								design in Photoshop. I then decided that it wasn’t good enough. Instead, I chose
								to go for the default styles used in all of Apple’s apps and Twitter. If it is
								good enough for <a href="http://www.atebits.com/">Loren Brichter</a>, it is good enough for
								me.

							</p>
							<p>
								I didn’t implement search functionality yet. Because I had to do lots of messy
								stuff (such as creating a custom version of sqlite), I stepped back and thought
								about whether I would need it. For now, I’ll stay lean and not add it, and see
								if it will become necessary.

							</p>
							<p>
								I also removed the location feature (because it wasn’t implemented yet). I don’t
								think it is necessary, although it would make a nice add-on. I look forward to
								the beta-testers’ feedback to see what they think of it.

							</p>
							<p>
								Today I spent polishing the features I had, trying to minimize the UI and keep
								everything very simple. The app is now quite minimal, but it does the job. Now
								it’s time to send out some beta’s!
