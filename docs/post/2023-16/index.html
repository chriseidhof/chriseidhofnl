								At the start of the week, I worked on making our (private) SwiftUI library for drawing tree diagrams a bit simpler. It has code for both drawing the diagrams as well as parsing the type of a view and turning that into an interactive diagram. I separated that into two packages and simplified the tree diagramming library.

								On Tuesday we recorded some Swift Talk episodes, and on Wednesday I spent time around the new house and with the family.

								On Thursday and Friday, Florian and me sat down to finally start typesetting <a href="https://www.objc.io/books/thinking-in-swiftui/">Thinking in SwiftUI</a>. We tackled a whole bunch of stuff: the cover pages, much of the typography, highlighting, styling, and so on. A bunch of this code is in the <a href="https://github.com/objcio/attributed-string-builder">attributed string builders</a> package. We still need to add tests and documentation for those features, but for now, we just build what we need and test it by looking at the generated PDF.
							</p>
							<p>
								I’m still not sure whether or not us writing the book generation ourselves (on top of attributed strings and TextKit) is a good idea, but it definitely is a lot of fun. For now it still seems very promising and much easier to write than LaTeX or using a program like InDesign. But let’s see what we think about this in a few years from now…

								We left our temporary holiday home and went on a trip to visit our family in The Netherlands. When we get back, we’ll officialy and finally move into (the ground floor of) the new house. Very exciting!
