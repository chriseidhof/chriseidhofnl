								Start of Week 2
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								Today is the start of the second week of the <a href="/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff">One App in Four
									Weeks</a> challenge.

							</p>
							<p>
								Last Friday, I added tabs to the application: one for the most recent checkins,
								and one for the list of contacts. More tabs will probably come, such as search
								and settings.

							</p>
							<p>
								This week, I will try to get the functionality done. I need to add a Person view
								(after you press on a Person you see the history), fix some shortcuts I took,
								add search and add a passcode lock (as Lucas said, this is indeed a very
								sensitive application).

							</p>
							<p>
								As <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/robertgaal">Robert</a> mentioned on Twitter, it would be
								nice if you can minimize the amount of input. He suggested not doing free text
								input, and while I agree that would be nice I still think it’s valuable to have
								a free text input (although smart autocompletion could help out in minimizing
								the amount you need to type).

							</p>
							<p>
								After the implementation, the next steps would be to work on the branding and
								the design. I am a bit afraid of the design part, as I am not a very good
								designer (I don’t have a great eye for detail and sometimes lack the patience
								when designing). So for the designers who are reading along, I would be very
								interested in your ideas.

							</p>
							<p>
								For the branding, I thought of a great name (Dossier), but it’s already used by
								some other apps (one of which does a similar thing). However, I didn’t really
								put any effort into it so far, so after a good brainstorming session I’ll come
								up with a name.
