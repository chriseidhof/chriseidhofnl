								Communicate Often
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								This advice is for freelancers: please communicate as often as possible. When
								somebody hires you, they want to know what’s going on. Sometimes you get so
								caught up in trying to make a deadline or staying productive, and forget to
								communicate. For a client, this can be frustrating, because it looks like
								nothing happens (while you were even busier than you would normally be).

							</p>
							<p>
								In my opinion, bad communication is one of the hardest problems in technology
								(and in life in general). Improving your communication is always a good
								thing.

							</p>
							<p>
								If I were your client, I would definitely appreciate these things:

							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										Let me know when you know you won’t make the deadline.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Ask me if you don’t understand something.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										If something is a bad idea, please say so. It’s your professional
										responsibility.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Send progress reports
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Let me know when you will contact me again.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										If you’re too busy to reply, please say so.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										If you work for a fixed price, but I’m requesting something outside of the
										budget, let me know.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										If something unexpected happens that will delay things, please let me know.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										If you need my feedback on something, please make sure I understand it’s a
										question.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Send emails that are to the point: explain things in short, understandable
										phrases.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								I’ve yet to hire somebody who communicates too often. In true Gruber style, I
								wrote this and imagined myself as the audience: my own communication would
								improve a lot if I followed the advice in this post.
