							<p>
								This is the start of week 3 of my <a href="/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff">One App in Four
									Weeks</a> project. Last Friday, I
								sent out the first beta version, and just sent an update (with mostly
								bugfixes).

							</p>
							<p><a href="http://martijnreintjes.com/">Martijn Reintjes</a> suggested that I should change
								Checkins to Meetups, and I couldn’t agree more. I wasn’t happy with Checkins to
								start with, and this makes it a lot simpler. Thanks dude!

							</p>
							<p>
								Because I wanted to be future-proof, I decided to change it everywhere in the
								code too. This took a while, refactoring all the code and setting up a Core Data
								migration. It turns out that XCode 4 is still a bit buggy when it comes to
								migrations, but after trying the same thing three times it worked
								(seriously).

							</p>
							<p>
								This weekend I was thinking about the name and branding. I currently have two
								options:

							</p>
							<p><strong>Meetups</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								This name describes exactly what it does. Meetups. There is no other app with
								that name yet, although there is the Meetup.com platform, which might be
								confusing.

							</p>
							<p><strong>James</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the name I like the most so far: calling it James. James helps you to
								record who you meet. James treats your information as confidential. James
								doesn’t get in the way. James is personal. I was thinking of using an image
								similar to this for the logo:

							</p>
							<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1264810/man.png" title="James"/>.

							</p>
							<p>
								As always, let me know what you think: send an email or mention/message me on
								Twitter.
