								The Big Plan
							</h1>

						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								When I was 15, I started my first job as a web developer. I worked for a local
								computer repair shop, and the clients needed websites, so I designed and built
								them. I built my first CMS, which my boss dubbed IWOS: Internet Web Online
								System. I guess that I already learned at that time that having a boss can suck.
								Fast forward 11 years later, I have had numerous development jobs. For the last
								few years, I’ve been a freelance developer. About 3 months ago, I decided to
								move to Berlin to start a startup with somebody else, which unfortunately didn’t
								work out (I might blog more on that later). However, going back to freelance
								development doesn’t feel quite right, I really have the urge to do work that
								lasts longer, to create products instead of doing projects.

							</p>
							<p>
								I’m now in a position where I can do that: I have some money saved up, have
								front-end and back-end skills, can develop iOS appliactions, have read a lot
								about startups and products, don’t have big commitments, not planning to start a
								family soon, don’t own a house: <em>there really is no more reason to procrastinate
									longer</em>
								. I have a lot of ideas for applications, and going to release my first
								application soon (an app that tracks your location permanently, stores it in a
								database and lets you export all the data via email). I will use this blog to
								update on my progress.

							</p>
							<p>
								My goal is to set up <em>multiple passive sources of income</em>
								 by selling software.
								Specifically, I am going to focus on building iOS apps, which I think is the
								most interesting platform now. In 9 months from now, I want to be able to live
								off of the income I am making by selling software. I want to have <em>at least 3
									products that are available for sale</em>
								. Until I reach that goal, I am going to
								make sure my savings will not fall below a certain threshold by doing some
								freelance jobs. Another important goal is to <em>stay location independent</em>
								: I am
								now living in Berlin, but am going to Spain for a few months, and maybe to a
								different continent after that.

							</p>
							<p>
								For me, the most difficult thing will be actually shipping software. I can start
								really quickly on a project and crank out a lot of code in very little time, but
								when it comes to polishing the details and doing the non-programming work I tend
								to slack off. Therefore, by making this public commitment I hope to push myself
								a little, and also inspire other people. By the way, my biggest source of
								inspiration is the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> community. 

							</p>
							<p>
								Stay tuned for more news and product releases.
