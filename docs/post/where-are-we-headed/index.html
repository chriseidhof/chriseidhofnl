								I’ve been thinking a lot about what my role (as a teacher) is with the LLMs. To do so, I also want to better understand what software development will look like a few years from now.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the trend continues, it might become true that building software is essentially free. I think it’s already true that experienced people can very quickly prompt themselves to a finished piece of software, and might become even quicker with an even higher quality.
							</p>
							<p>
								You already see people building massive amounts of software with LLMs. Look at <a href="https://github.com/steipete">Peter’s list</a> of current project: at the time of writing it’s 44 projects. Likewise, I read the following quote by Armin Ronacher:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									I ended up building and building and creating a ton of tools I did not end up using much. (<a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/1/18/agent-psychosis/">source</a>)
								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Yesterday I chatted to <a href="https://alper.nl">Alper</a> about this topic. He’s often been on the right side of predicting the future. For example, he predicted <a href="https://alper.nl/posts/chat-as-an-important-new-platform-for-user-experience/">chat as an interface</a> in 2015. One thing he mentioned which stuck: when it becomes practically free to build software, the bottleneck will be people who judge <em>what to build</em>
