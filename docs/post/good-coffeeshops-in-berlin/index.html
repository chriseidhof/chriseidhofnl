								Good coffeeshops in Berlin
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								If you’re a digital nomad, you are always looking for good places to work. In
								Berlin, there are a couple of good places with good wifi and coffee. Here is a
								list of the places where I like to work.

							</p>
							<p><strong><a href="http://www.sanktoberholz.de/">St. Oberholz</a> -</strong>
								 <a href="http://maps.google.nl/maps?q=st%20oberholz&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=nl&tab=wl">Rosenthaler Strasse 72</a>

							</p>
							<p>
								This is <em>the</em>
								 place for a digital nomad. They serve excellent coffee, have good
								food and it is well known for being friendly towards people with laptops.
								Upstairs is extra seating available. Sometimes the wifi is a bit flaky.

							</p>
							<p><strong><a href="http://www.mein-haus-am-see.blogspot.com/">Mein Haus am See</a></strong>
								 -<a href="http://maps.google.nl/maps?q=mein%20haus%20am%20see">Brunnestrasse 197 - 198</a>

							</p>
							<p>
								Across the street from St. Oberholz, Mein Haus am See is a special place. A bit
								less well known, and more a bar than a coffee place. The coffee is not that
								good, but the wifi is a lot better than St. Oberholz.

							</p>
							<p><strong><a href="http://www.cuccuma.de/">Cuccuma</a></strong>
								 - <a href="http://maps.google.nl/maps?q=Cuccuma&hl=nl&ll=52.490777,13.394351&spn=0.010779,0.019891&sll=52.490614,13.394361&sspn=0.011106,0.019891&z=16">Zossener
									Strasse 34</a>

							</p>
							<p>
								This is my favorite place to work. They have excellent coffee, good wifi, great
								service and nice sandwiches. Upstairs is a kind of balcony where you can sit and
								work while having a nice view on the street. Close to the Bergmanstrasse which
								is filled with nice restaurants and shops.

							</p>
							<p><strong><a href="http://www.blinis-espressolounge.de/">Espresso Lounge</a></strong>
								 -<a href="http://maps.google.nl/maps?q=espresso+lounge+berlin&hl=nl&ll=52.489477,13.393879&spn=0.005553,0.009946&sll=36.73878,-95.587706&sspn=58.519471,81.474609&z=17&iwloc=A">Bergmanstrasse 92</a>

							</p>
							<p>
								A nice place to work with good coffee. They don’t really serve food, except for
								cake (the chocolate cake is really nice). Close to Cuccuma and on the
								Bergmanstrasse. In the back it’s more quiet, in the front you have a nice street
								view.

							</p>
							<p><strong><a href="http://www.nstp.de/">Wendel</a></strong>
								 - <a href="http://maps.google.nl/maps?q=wendel+berlin&hl=nl&ll=52.500941,13.446751&spn=0.021265,0.039783&sll=52.489477,13.393879&sspn=0.005553,0.009946&fll=52.50337,13.443103&fspn=0.021264,0.039783&z=15">Schlesische
									Strasse 42</a>

							</p>
							<p>
								If you’re not an early riser, Wendel might be the place for you. Fast internet
								and really good coffee. No real tables to work on, but very relaxed. They also
								have good lunch.
