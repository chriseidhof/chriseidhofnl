								A few weeks ago, after Apple announced their new programming language Swift, it
								became very clear to me that we had to write a book on <a href="http://www.objc.io/books/">Functional Programming
									in Swift</a>. Once the idea was there, I just couldn’t stop
								thinking about it anymore. After getting <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004/">Wouter</a> and <a href="http://floriankugler.com">Florian</a> on board, I knew we had a killer team for writing this book.
							</p>
							<p>
								We decided to do give people early access, so they can read along and comment
								as we proceed with the writing. So far, the response has been really great, and I’m really happy that we chose to do this. It works like this: after people buy the early access version, we immediately grant them access to a GitHub repository where they can read and comment on the chapters we’ve written so far.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the things I only realized after we started: if we do this right, we
								might write a book that is still relevant in 5 or 10 years. The book is not
								about any specific frameworks, it’s about doing functional programming.
								Frameworks might change a lot, the principles of functional programming have been the same for a really long time.
								Because we write our chapters using <a href="https://github.com/chriseidhof/literate-swift">literate
									programming</a> it’s very easy for
								us to update them later on as the language evolves.
							</p>
							<p>
								After we brainstormed a lot of ideas (way more than we could possibly fit into
								one book) we picked the best ones, and starting writing chapter outlines and example
								code. I’m so excited about some of the examples we’ll show you: they make
								things that were previously complex now very simple. Functional programming can
								be like that: making certain programs smaller by a huge factor.
							</p>
							<p>
								What I love about Swift is that it allows us to mix functional and
								object-oriented programming. We can keep doing all the great stuff that we
								know, we can keep using all of Apple’s great APIs, but at the same time we can
								write parts of our program in a functional style. This book will hopefully show
								you examples where the functional style is way more powerful.
