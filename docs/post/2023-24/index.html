								We went over the chapters of our book and tried to make an inventory of what we need to add. Most significantly, - the state chapter needs to describe the new way that object observing works, and the animations chapter needs a number of additions.
							</p>
							<p>
								We then prepared everything for the launch. This is a bit of a tedious manual process (updating all the website pages, the bundles, all the items on Gumroad, etc.). On Friday we launched the <a href="https://www.objc.io/books/thinking-in-swiftui">prerelease of Thinking in SwiftUI</a>. We also did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYgAd-LF-UE">live Q&amp;A</a> which was really fun. We plan to do these weekly so please <a href="https://github.com/objcio/thinking-in-swiftui-qa/">send in your questions</a>. Here’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4sSC7scvRw">Q&amp;A for this Friday</a>.

								On Saturday I ran my first marathon in about a year. I have not trained as much (although I have been ramping up my mileage over the last month and a half) and I was very glad to see that I was only four minutes slower than last year (same course, but this year the weather was not as hot). I thought my shape was a lot worse, this is a good starting point to build off of. Although I did try to stay reasonably fit during the house renovation phase, I know I lost a lot of speed and endurance. Building these up again is very simple for me, but no so easy: when I consistently run a lot (more than 140k/week) over a long period of time (a year or longer) I get very fit.
							</p>
							<p>
								I’m thinking of structuring my upcoming training similar to <a href="https://www.howtoskate.se">Nils van der Poel</a>. Although his event is quite different (a speed-skating 10k lasts less 13 minutes whereas a fast marathon lasts almost three hours). I wonder if I should do even more aerobic training and less threshold than he describes.
