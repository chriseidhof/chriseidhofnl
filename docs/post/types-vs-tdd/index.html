								This morning, I read <a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/01/11/TheDarkPath.html">an article</a> against static typing. To be more precise: it argues against static typing in the way Swift/Kotlin implement it. I don’t know anything about Kotlin, so I’ll try to relate everything to Swift.  The main point of the article is that too much static typing is a bad thing. I agree: although my definition of “too much” is very different.
							</p>
							<p>
								The main point of critique is that we can’t possibly keep adding features to a language to solve actual problems, because we would end up with too many features. Instead, we should solve everything by writing tests. I don’t think it’s an either/or situation at all: we can have a solid type system and write “manual” tests.
							</p>
							<p>
								A type checker actually does testing for you. It’s not a replacement for TDD, but it allows you to completely get rid of a whole bunch of tests. For example, if you define a method <code>foo</code> that returns an <code>Int</code>, you can be sure it will only return <code>Int</code>s. Not <code>String</code>s, not <code>nil</code> or <code>null</code>, not anything else. No need to write a test.
							</p>
							<p>
								The article argues that specifying a type such as <code>Int</code> is very inflexible: what if you ever wanted to change <code>foo</code> to return an optional?  According to the article, you have to know this before you write the system. (And if I interpret the article correctly, it argues that TDD would solve this).
							</p>
							<p>
								I agree on at least one thing: at some point, code is going to change. However, I couldn’t disagree more on the statement that typing makes this hard.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Swift, once you change <code>foo</code> to return an <code>Int?</code>, the compiler will now show an error for each time you call <code>foo</code>. This makes it <em>easy</em>
								 to make that change, because until you have reviewed every single call to <code>foo</code>, the program simply won’t compile. I think of the compile errors as a todo-list, not as a <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/819262224686546945">speed bump</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								When you make changes (small or large ones), it’s good to have a system in place that checks whether your code still works. With many kinds of changes, the compiler can do this automatically. You don’t have to write tests for that.
							</p>
							<p>
								Don’t get me wrong: types are not a silver bullet. You still need to test your code. But wouldn’t you rather test interesting parts, and leave the boring stuff to the compiler?
