							<p>
								Over Christmas, I read<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820">Antifragile</a>by Taleb. The book has had quite an impact on me, and I decided to change some
								things. Long story short: I want to be open to positive black swans. A positive
								black swan is an event that will happen with a low probability, but if it does
								happen, it has a big impact.

							</p>
							<p>
								Taleb’s strategy for investing is to invest mostly in very safe things, and make
								small bets with a limited downside, but an unlimited upside. He calls this the
								dumbbell strategy. Applied to my own business as a freelance software developer,
								this means that I will be continuing and expanding my freelancing business for
								most of the time. But I am also spending time on projects that have a limited
								cost, but an unlimited upside. I’m not expecting that most of these projects
								will be a wild success, but you only have to win big once…

							</p>
							<p>
								One of these projects is organizing a conference. This will definitely not have
								an unlimited financial upside (best case, we might make a little bit of money,
								but it would be way more effective to spend that time freelancing). However, I
								do think that very nice things will happen because of this: meet more people,
								get known a bit better in the tech scene, and work together with really
								interesting people.

							</p>
							<p>
								Also, I have a renewed focus on building and maintaining my own apps. I’m
								working on an update for <a href="http://eidhof.nl/trackme">TrackMe</a> (I know it needs a
								better website and UI). I have some other interesting ideas for new apps too,
								hopefully I can move some of these projects forward so they can be released
								publicly.

							</p>
							<p>
								On a personal level, I am planning to go to more parties. This is directly
								copied from Taleb. At parties, you have a chance of meeting very interesting
								people. Probably at most parties you’ll have a good time, but won’t meet anybody
								new who’s interesting. However, when you do, all the other parties will have
								been worth it.

							</p>
							<p>
								Also, I want to work together with more people. One of the ways this will happen
								is having an office instead of working from home. Another way will be by hiring
								more people. If you’re interested in learning iOS Development, or if you’re a
								copywriter, get in touch.

							</p>
							<p>
								I wonder how this strategy will work. I see it as something long-term, the
								payoff might only come in a decade. Let’s see.
