								iOS products are a local optimum

								This morning, I was sitting in the booming heart of Seville, sipping my café con
								
								leche and reading <a href="http://zackarymorris.tumblr.com/post/10973087527/the-state-of-the-art-is-terrible" title>The State of the Art is
									
									Terrible</a>
								by Zack Morris. A great read indeed.

							</p>
							<p>
								It then finally dawned on me: most apps are a local optimum. This includes most
								
								of the apps I’ve worked on, including the most successful ones. Another fine
								
								example is the gorgeous
								<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/thermo/id414215658?mt=8" title>Thermo</a> app. Even
								
								though I love using it, it is just another way to view the weather forecast. It
								
								hardly adds any value to the world.

							</p>
							<p>
								I disagree with Zack about whether the iPad is changing computing. I think it
								
								does, because it opens up computing to a much bigger audience. It makes it more
								
								accessible for big groups of people (very young people, old people and people
								
								who aren’t technically minded). This is a big step forward.

							</p>
							<p>
								However, most of the things you can do on an iPad were possible on desktop
								
								computers as well. We are advancing, but the applications don’t necessarily get
								
								smarter. Most of the applications that get released are just a beautiful skin
								
								with basic functionality.

							</p>
							<p>
								Now, I don’t think all hope is lost. Even though we aren’t creating smarter
								
								applications yet, we at least have improved one massively important factor:
								
								usability. Now is the time to put our CS degrees to good use and make the
								
								applications more intelligent. I think Siri is a great example of this. It’s
								
								very advanced, but they hid everything behind the most simple user interface
								
								possible.

							</p>
							<p>
								As for me, I’m sticking to making relatively simple applications, for now. I
								
								don’t mind the local optimum. I’ll try to set up a passive income so I can
								
								work on bigger things. Hopefully, it won’t be very long before I get there.
								
								Also, I have so much to learn regarding the building of products, designing and
								
								marketing, which will be very useful once I will build bigger things.

							</p>
							<p>
								I don’t think the MVP strategy will take us to huge innovations. It is great for
								
								the products I want to build now, but for really big things, we probably need a
								
								different strategy. This is also expressed in the article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/opinion/the-man-who-inspired-jobs.html" title>The Man Who Inspired
									
									Jobs</a>.
								
								I especially liked the quote:

							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									Market research is what you do when your product isn’t any good.

								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								However, you have to have the right background to say this. For an entrepreneur
								
								like me, with hardly any experience, this is not true. I’ll make sure to get my
								
								experience in building products, and then I’ll try to build bigger things.
