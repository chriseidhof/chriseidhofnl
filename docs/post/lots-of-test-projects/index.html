							<p>
								This might be a trivial thing, and I might be stupid for not having done with it
								all my life, but this was a big insight for me. Only a few months ago, I really
								started making lots of small test projects to only test out a specific feature
								or solution. For example, I have a project that implements UITableViewCells with
								XIBs, a test project for working with local notifications, a test project to
								play around with rotation events and more. By doing these tests in a separate
								project, I get the following two advantages:

							</p>
							<p><strong>Lower barrier to testing the new feature</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Sometimes when I want to test out a new feature in one of my apps I get held
								back by the fact that it might be complicated to implement. My code will get
								cluttered and I have to wade through lots of old code. I need to do lots of
								integration before I can even test it. This allows me to focus on the feature
								first and integrate it once I’m happy with it.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Future Reference</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Having these test projects around is great for future reference. The feature or
								solution is implemented on its own, so when I want to use it in a different
								project I don’t have to separate it out from the rest of the code.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Question</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Do you have any test projects? How do you organize code for future reference?
								Keep a notebook? Just dig into old projects? Grep your repos? <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2945167">Discuss at Hacker
