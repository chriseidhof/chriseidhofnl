								Met In The App Store

							<p>
								This morning at 10:11 GMT+1, version 1.0 of Met was submitted to the App Store.
								It’s been quite an experience, blogging about everything, from before there was
								an idea until the App Store submission. I will write a recap of everything next
								week.

							</p>
							<p>
								In the last few days, I’ve been helping out with an ultra marathon, and met a
								lot of interesting and inspiring people. There was a 73-year old guy who ran 160
								kilometers (100 miles) who finished without any problems. Very impressive. After
								the race, I travelled to Málaga and yesterday I got back to The Netherlands.
								During this time, I felt bad for not writing about Met, as it was almost ready.
								Yesterday, I fixed a last bug while I was waiting on the airport.

							</p>
							<p>
								Travelling always makes me come up with new thoughts. The faster I travel, the
								bigger the thoughts seem to be. As I was in an airplane yesterday, I had some
								high-level ideas about what to do with my life.

							</p>
							<p>
								At this moment, I found out that making enough money from selling my own
								products is a little harder than I thought. However, I really love what I’m
								doing, and I’m having a great time. It is probably going to take me longer than
								I expected to be able to live off of the passive income made from my apps, but
								I’m not worried about that. In the meantime, I’ll do some client projects
								(anybody looking for an iOS developer?).

							</p>
							<p>
								Now that the first version of Met is submitted to the App Store, it’s almost
								time for some other projects. I still need to write a press release and send it
								out, but after that is fully prepared I look forward to work on some other
								projects. One thing I’ll be working is the <a href="/post/ive-got-an-idea-for-an-app">super-secret
									project</a> I wrote about earlier. The
								physical prototypes are almost ready, and the first version of the iPhone app
								too. Also, <a href="http://ulischoeberl.com/">Uli</a> and I are going to spend a week
								getting the app done that we’ve worked on and talked about for the last few
								months.

							</p>
							<p>
								I love running, and have been training quite heavily for the last 1.5 years. I
								track all my running using my Garmin 405 watch, and all the activities are
								uploaded to Garmin Connect, a webservice for analyzing everything about your
								workout. However, they don’t have an iPhone or iPad client, and I would love to
								have a decent app for that. This is one of the ideas I’m thinking about building
								next.
