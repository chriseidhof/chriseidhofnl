								About a week ago, I read <a href="http://www.startupsopensourced.com/2011/07/28/19-year-old-stanford-ph-d-dropout-andrew-hsu-is-changing-education/%20">this
									interview</a>with Andrew Hsu. He said one of his ways to be productive is making your
								todo-list the night before. I’ve tried this for a few days now, and it seems to
								work. For the last few day, I really got a lot done.

								One of the reasons why I think it works is because it can help you focus on the
								right tasks. Stephen Covey wrote about his <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FourQuadrants">four
									quadrants</a>, which can help to classify
								your tasks. On one axis, you have important and non-important tasks, on the
								other axis there are urgent and non-urgent tasks. We naturally give priority to
								urgent tasks, whether they are important or not. What often gets postponed is
								the important but non-urgent tasks. <em>By making your todo-list the night before,
									it can help you to focus on the important tasks.</em>
