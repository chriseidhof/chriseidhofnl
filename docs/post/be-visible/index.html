							<p>
								Whatever you are doing, make sure you’re visible. Don’t fear embarrassment and
								publish yourself, in whichever form. Here are three stories:

							</p>
							<p><strong>Twitter</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								As I wrote in an <a href="/post/ive-got-an-idea-for-an-app">earlier post</a>, I
								became iPhone developer by chance. Just for fun, we created a game called<a href="http://cookiecombo.com/">CookieCombo</a> to play around with the iPhone SDK, which
								came out a few months earlier. We tweeted about it, and got two instant gigs out
								of it: we built the app for Wakoopa and the app for NRC (a leading Dutch
								newspaper). After that, we were the guys who built NRC, and got many gigs out of
								that.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Blogging</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Since I started blogging, I got a lot of followers on Twitter, on Tumblr and a
								lot of email. I’m definitely not the best developer out there (although I
								consider myself competent enough), but I am easy to find. People stumble upon my
								blog, and come to me with their iPhone idea.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Speaking</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								By speaking at small meetups or conferences, I made a lot of friends. If you
								write or speak about a topic, people consider you an expert. When I was
								freelancing, a lot of people referred potential clients to me, because they
								remembered me from one of these events.

							</p>
							<p>
								The key takeaway point is: be publicly visible. Put yourself out there: write,
								speak, blog, tweet, help, teach, email, whatever works for you. This has the
								awesome side effect that <em>people find you</em>
								. Instead of having to search for
								clients, they come to you. Instead of having to find a good designer for your
								project, they might approach you because they want to work with you.
