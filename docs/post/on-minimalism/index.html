								On Minimalism
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								A few years ago, I first read <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html">Stuff</a> by
								Paul Graham. The article really resonated with me, even though I was living in a
								small room at the time and didn’t have that much stuff. In recent months, I have
								been discussing similar topics with some of my friends, philosofying about<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living">Minimalism</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a> and<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. Since then, I have been
								actively trying to get rid of more stuff and making my life simpler in general.
								Below I discuss a couple of ways in which I implemented this:

							</p>
							<p><strong>Less stuff</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								The first step is to have less stuff. Before I moved to Berlin, I got rid of
								most of the things I own. I still have some things in storage (for example, I
								couldn’t bring myself to getting rid of my books). I went to Berlin with a
								suitcase and a small messenger bag. After my friend visited a few weeks ago, he
								took my suitcase and I’m left with a backpack and a messenger bag. In Berlin,
								the only furniture I own is a mattress and a drying rack for my clothes (a chair
								and desk would have been nice, I admit). While this probably sounds very
								uncomfortable to you, it actually isn’t, once you get used to it.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Simpler eating</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								A few months ago I tried 30 days without any candy, crisps or soft drinks. I
								limited my food to three meals a day, no snacks in between. This felt great. I
								stopped worrying about what candy to eat next, felt healthier and emotionally
								more stable. Even though I didn’t make it into a permanent habit and eat sugar
								again every now and then, I am considering doing the experiment again for a
								longer time.

							</p>
							<p><strong>No apartment</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I cancelled my apartment in The Netherlands. I now rent apartments for a short
								time (say, a few months). It feels very liberating to be able to cancel the
								rent, pack my stuff and move on. I don’t get too attached to one place. Even
								though I’m not sure whether I’ll like it in the long run, it feels great right
								now.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Simpler social life</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								In Berlin, I don’t have nearly as many friends as in Utrecht. Whereas I used to
								have my agenda fully booked (read about <a href="http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2011/07/29/scheduling-agenda-appointments/">Dutch people and Their
									Agendas</a>),
								I now call people to meet instead of making an appointment to meet in a few
								weeks. Again, this makes my life so much simpler.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Information diet</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								This is a step I still want to implement better: go on an <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/category/low-information-diet-and-selective-ignorance/">information
									diet</a>.
								Three steps I already took: I haven’t watched television for more than half a
								year, I have read about 10 newspapers in the last years, and last week I clicked
								“unsubscribe” in Google Reader instead of “Mark all as read” on about 20
								blogs.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Kindle</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I love to read. A nice side-effect is that I had a good bookcase for showing
								off. The step to buying a Kindle was not an easy one, but has worked very well.
								It takes a bit of getting used to, but I’m a big fan now. I can take my books
								everywhere I want, and they are generally cheaper too.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Where will this end? If I continue like this, will I find myself in a Tibetan
								monastery meditating in a few years from now? I don’t think so. Even though I’m
								slowly simplifying my life, I’m sure I’ll have a fallback every now and then.
								There definitely is a tension between pleasure and minimalism, but so far I feel
								very happy. Keep reading this blog to find out what it’s like in a few years
								from now.
