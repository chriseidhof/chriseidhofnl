								New build, first website, press plans

								Yesterday I released a new build. In this version, you can also change the date
								of events (which means you can add past events) and add new contacts from within
								the app.

							</p>
							<p>
								Today I set up a <a href="http://eidhof.nl/met/">first webpage</a> for Met. I really like
								the design of With, and I let myself be inspired. Admittedly, the website is
								quite minimal, but I think it should be enough (for now). I also found a good
								domain name, which I’m in the process of registering now.

							</p>
							<p>
								I want to do multivariate testing on the website background, slogan and text,
								but can of course only do this once I’ve got some traffic going. Which raises
								another question: how are people going to find me?

							</p>
							<p>
								In the past, I’ve had good experiences with sending press releases to Dutch
								weblogs such as <a href="http://iphoneclub.nl">iPhoneClub</a> and<a href="http://www.onemorething.nl/">OneMoreThing</a>. In addition to this, I also would
								like to get featured on English-language iPhone sites, and sites such as<a href="http://lifehacker.com/">LifeHacker</a>. First I need to compile a list of sites
								that could potentially feature me, then I need to write a press release and send
								it to all of them.

							</p>
							<p>
								As always, if you have tips or suggestions let me know.
