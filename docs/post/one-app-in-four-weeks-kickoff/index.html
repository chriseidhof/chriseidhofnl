								One app in four weeks: kickoff
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								When I woke up this morning I heard the sound of the Mediterranean sea and saw
								palm trees out the window. Yesterday night I arrived in Malaga, Spain. I’ll be
								slowly travelling around the area for the next few weeks. I probably won’t be
								working full days, as it’s very beautiful here, and there are a lot of things to
								see and do.

							</p>
							<p>
								Originally, I had a nice plan for my work-related time during these weeks: build
								four apps in four weeks. I really liked the idea: build a simple app and get it
								out as quickly as I can. While I still like the idea, Jay Fuerstenberg had a
								great comment on that: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jayfuerstenberg/status/115773083461234688">@chriseidhof I’d rather see you think for 1 week on a
									great app and make it in 3 weeks. #AppStore has enough junk
									apps</a>. Very
								true.

							</p>
							<p>
								Therefore, I’ll do things differently: I’ll make an app in four weeks. This
								week, I’m going to evaluate three ideas and draw out sketches and interface
								prototypes. I’ll try to post an update almost daily.

							</p>
							<p>
								I’ll try to document the whole process of building an app on this blog: choosing
								an idea, going from sketches to a prototype to a working version, and polishing
								the app. I’ll talk about the branding and marketing, and I would really
								appreciate your comments on everything.

							</p>
							<p>
								My <em>first idea</em>
								 is an app for learning how to do something: like an ebook, but
								designed for iPad from the ground up: way more interactive, with something to do
								for almost every page. Writing, design and coding will go hand in hand. I’m not
								sure what the topic should be: learning HTML 5, learning to negotiate, learning
								a part of math interactively (for example, differentiation) or learning basic
								iPhone programming.

							</p>
							<p>
								The <em>second idea</em>
								 is an iPad app for building interactive iPhone prototypes. A
								friend of mine asked me why there is no decent one yet, they are all too
								complicated. I haven’t researched this area yet, so maybe it already
								exists.

							</p>
							<p>
								The <em>third idea</em>
								 is an iPhone app for making notes about people. I meet a lot of
								people, and I would like to start making notes about them. After meeting them,
								I’ll jot down a few notes, and the next time I meet a person I can see a
								history of the meetings we had, and maybe also quickly browse his social
								profiles (in a similar way to Rapportive). I can also imagine a “check-in” like
								function, where you only record that you met the person, including the place and
								time.

							</p>
							<p>
								I would love to hear your thoughts. Which of these apps would you like to see?
								Please leave a comment, and I’ll try to pick the right idea tomorrow or the day
								after that.
