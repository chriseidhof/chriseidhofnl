							<p>
								Last week I went to Paris to speak at <a href="https://swiftconnection.io">Swift Connection</a>. This was really fun — I met new and old friends and it was generally really nice to be among other Swift developers (in our tiny town I’m the only one).
							</p>
							<p>
								My presentation was about different techniques available for building SwiftUI animations. This was the first time I used the new “play back typing” tool during a presentation. This went really well, there was a small hiccup but luckily someone in the audience caught it and called it out. While the talk was still fresh I recorded a version at home and <a href="https://chris.eidhof.nl/presentations/swiftui-animations/">published it here</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								The train ride back from Paris to Fürstenberg went well, too. I was able to spend a lot of that time working productively. I have no numbers, but when I think about it purely in terms of efficiency: the whole hassle of flying (going to the airport, waiting, checking in, and so on) is a lot more stressful to me, and I wonder if I could have gotten any more work done, even with the few hours saved.
