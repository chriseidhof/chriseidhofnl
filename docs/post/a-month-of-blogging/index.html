								A month of blogging
							</h1>

							<p>
								As a tribute to Gabriel Weinberg’s <a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2011/08/why-i-blog.html">Why I
									Blog</a>, here’s my
								experience about starting and committing to this blog. Even though I’ve only
								been blogging for a month, it’s already been a tremendous experience. Now that
								I’m the rythm of writing a small article every workday, it seems hard to break
								that chain of posts.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Helps you understand</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I couldn’t agree more with Gabriel, writing helps to understand yourself. Vague
								feelings have to be expressed using clear language. You start to think about
								what is important, and how to explain it. When I now think about a problem I
								can’t help but thinking about how to write about it, which helps me focusing
								on understanding and explaining the problem.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Great feedback and insights</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								The feedback I got so far has been amazing. First of all, the discussions on
								Hacker News are so valuable and the commenters give such good insights. For
								example, take this comment by danieldk on yesterday’s post:

							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									However paradoxical, minimalism can be also an be attachment. As Buddhists
									would say, take the middle road.

								</p>
							</blockquote>

							<p>
								Also, I’ve gotten to know a lot of interesting people via e-mail, Skype, Twitter
								and even some in real life because of writing this blog. My life definitely
								feels richer for it.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Public commitment</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Making a <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Cognitive-Dissonance-and-Public-Commitment&id=293095">public
									commitment</a>is shown to be a very effective way of getting things done. As for me, I’ve made
								public commitment to become an indie developer and this helps me to push through
								the times of doubt.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Building an audience</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								At this moment, a 101 people follow me on tumblr (a month ago it was 0 people).
								On Twitter, I went from 488 followers a month ago to 663 at the moment of
								writing. That’s an increase of 49% in just a month, which I’m very thankful
								for.
