								One App in Four Weeks: Week 1
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								This Monday, I started <a href="/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff">One App in Four
									Weeks</a>. I started by posting a
								list of ideas. The third idea was the most appealling to people (although I
								still want to build the other two as well, but not now), and I got some great
								feedback from everybody.

							</p>
							<p>
								I selected the idea and <a href="/post/check-in-to-people">defined the Minimum Viable
									Product</a>, which is quite simple: you can
								check in to people, add a time and note to that checkin and possibly a location
								as well.

							</p>
							<p>
								Yesterday I wrote about the first <a href="/post/sketches-and-ideas">sketches and
									ideas</a>, and after that I started working
								on the very first version.

							</p>
							<p>
								Normally I don’t show these first versions to people, but because I want to show
								you all the steps I’ll include the screenshots today. The app is barely
								functional: you see a list of Checkins, and when you press the ‘+’ button it
								shows the list of your contacts in Address Book. Tapping on a contact takes you
								to the ‘Add Checkin’ screen, where you can add a note. The time is not
								changeable yet, and the location isn’t implemented at all. When you then press
								‘Done’ you’ll go back to the start screen, and the checkin was added. You can
								also edit it again by tapping on it.

							</p>
							<p>
								For the location, I’m thinking of using the Foursquare API, which can provide
								you with venue information based on lat/lon. I’ll probably store the locations
								and try to find a previously used location when possible (about half the time I
								meet people it’s in the same places).

							</p>
							<p>
								I also had some ideas about searching: I want to index all the words in the
								checkin database, and do autocompletion using those words. This means that
								searching can be a very fast experience. Search could probably be quite
								important: I can also imagine it’s handy if I want to find a PHP developer in my
								network (I always forget who knows which languages).
