								A few months ago I wrote about <a href="http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/14911964453/radical-honesty">radical
									honesty</a>. I tried being
								more honest, but in practice it’s quite awkward. Our society isn’t really used
								to being completely honest and open. For example, if a friend wears something I
								really dislike, I won’t tell him. It’s just my opinion, and by expressing it I
								don’t think I’ll help anybody.

							</p>
							<p>
								In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People">How To Win Friends and Influence
									People</a>,
								Dale Carnegie says things like ” “Don’t criticize, condemn or complain”, “The
								only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it” and “Show respect for
								the other person’s opinions. Never say, ‘You’re wrong.’”. In a way, you could
								interpret these statements as: don’t be honest when you disagree with
								somebody.

							</p>
							<p>
								Recently, I was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Proust-Change-Your-Life/dp/0679779159">How Proust Can Change Your
									Life</a> by my
								favorite modern philosopher Alain de Botton. He writes that Proust deliberately
								tried to avoid truth in friendship, lavishing his friends with compliments,
								sincere or not. This is pretty much the exact opposite of radical honesty, and
								equally exciting for me. A very interesting approach, although I don’t think
								I’ll use it.
