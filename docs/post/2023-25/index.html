								Last week, we had the post-launch week of our book, which is always fun. It’s nice to see the first feedback, which has been good so far. We also released a new chapter on state and binding. This one already has a bunch of (hopefully) helpful custom diagrams in there that show how the state system works. The chapter itself focuses on doing state using the pre-iOS17 way, and has pointers to the iOS 17 chapter (in which we explain the key differences and how to use the new state system). We also did our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4sSC7scvRw">second Q&amp;A livestream</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								We also recorded some episodes in which we reimplement a simplified version of the new observation framework in SwiftUI. It turns out this is not that hard to do (although as always, tricky to get just right).
							</p>

								I spent a morning and half an afternoon doing home improvement, mostly working on the final section of drywall (there’s one corner which wasn’t finished yet). Running also went well, I feel like I recovered very quickly from the marathon. I did take it quite easy the first few days of the week, which always helps.
							</p>

								In the garden things are growing well. We’re starting to see some tomatoes appear, have strawberries and raspberries, and the cucumber is now producing really well too. The edamame plants I sowed are also still alive. I’ve never grown edamame before, so it’s definitely an experiment that can fail.
