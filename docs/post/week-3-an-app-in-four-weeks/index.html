								Week 3: An App in Four Weeks
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								Today marks the end of Week 3 of my <a href="/post/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff" title>App in Four
									
									Weeks</a> challenge.

							</p>
							<p>
								This week I <a href="/post/introducing-met" title>chose a name</a>. I designed an
								
								icon and overall style for the app. I then spent quite some time implementing
								
								autorotation, and getting it exactly right. There is now a passcode lock
								
								too.

							</p>
							<p>
								By nature, I am not a perfectionist. Whenever I see that something works, I tend
								
								to lose interest in finishing it. For me, shipping things is a big deal, and
								
								hard to do. Normally, I lack the willpower to do polish and finish things. By
								
								making a very public commitment to build this app in four weeks, and by writing
								
								about it here, I can outsource my willpower: polishing and shipping becomes a
								
								lot easier. Delivering a bad app or not delivering at all would feel like a big
								
								embarrassment.

							</p>
							<p>
								So far, the process has been a marvelous experience. I had so much help from
								
								everybody: people who have feature requests, name suggestions, design
								
								suggestions, beta testers, people who tell me that they like this blog, and so
								
								on. If you consider doing something similar, I can only recommend it. My work
								
								becomes a lot better by doing this, and people who read this hopefully learn and
								
								get inspired, a win-win situation.

							</p>
							<p>
								Next week, I will not add any new big features, but instead polish what I have
								
								so far, set up a website and make a marketing plan. From Wednesday on I am
								
								volunteering at multi-day trail race, so I am not sure how much time I will have
								
								to work on Met.

							</p>
							<p>
								If there is any part of the process that you would like me to write about,
								
								please let me know.
