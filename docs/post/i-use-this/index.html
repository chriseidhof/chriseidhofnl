								I Use This

							<p>
								I was inspired by people writing about their setup on <a href="http://usesthis.com/">The
									Setup</a>, so I decided to write about my own setup.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Hardware</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I use a Mid 2010 Macbook Pro 15” with an SSD. I only switched last week, when my
								old hard drive was about to die. I don’t use any external screen, keyboard or
								mouse. Because I travel a lot and work from pretty much everywhere, the HD
								display is really convenient. I would like a more lightweight laptop, but don’t
								feel like compromising on the screen size.

							</p>
							<p>
								I also carry around an iPhone, and a very basic A4 note taking pad. The last one
								is essential, I like taking notes and doing sketching on real paper. I own an
								iPad, but don’t use it that much (mostly for development). For reading, I have a
								Kindle (which is probably the device I treasure the most).

							</p>
							<p><strong>Development</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Being an iOS developer, I spend most of my working hours in XCode. It’s not the
								most advanced IDE, but I think it’s important to stay with the tools Apple
								provides. To be fair, I don’t hate it either. And it keeps getting better with
								every release, although it lacks features that were in Eclipse many years
								ago.

							</p>
							<p>
								When I’m not doing iOS development, I use<a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>. I write all my other code in it, and
								do lots of text editing in it (this blog post is written in MacVim). I started
								learning Emacs as well, but the many years of learning vim make me feel slow in
								any other editor.

							</p>
							<p>
								For versioning, I only use Git. I do think it has a bad interface and often have
								problems remembering the exact commands. One of the things that did help me
								understand git a bit better was the chapter on <a href="http://book.git-scm.com/1_the_git_object_model.html">The Git Object
									Model</a> in the git community
								book.

							</p>
							<p>
								I recently changed my default shell from bash to zsh, and I really like it. I
								installed <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">Oh My Zsh</a> which provides
								you with awesome defaults and plugins. (Thanks for pointing it out to me
								Maik).

							</p>
							<p><strong>Other</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								For browsing, I use Chrome. I like the speed and minimalism of it.

							</p>
							<p>
								For note taking, I use Evernote. It works on my Mac, iPhone and iPad. And it’s
								really easy to have shared notebooks. Although I can definitely imagine a better
								product, it does the job.

							</p>
							<p>
								Another important app for me is<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>. I practice<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> and OmniFocus helps me
								keep my current projects and next actions organized. Any other GTD stuff I have
								is in Evernote.

							</p>
							<p><a href="http://www.acrylicapps.com/wallet/">Wallet</a> takes care of my passwords. It
								integrates nicely with Chrome, so I never have to remember all my different
								passwords.

							</p>
							<p>
								I used to run a mail server with my friends, but switched to GMail last year. I
								think Google probably takes better care of my data than I could do myself. I
								wouldn’t mind switching to a better, paid service which gives me good guarantees
								about my data.

							</p>
							<p>
								Most people don’t talk about this, but for exploring darker corners of the
								internet, I use the VPN service by IPredator. It gives me at least some sense of
								security.

							</p>
							<p><strong>Backups</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								For backups, I put a lot of stuff in my Dropbox folder. Also, I have<a href="http://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a> installed which backs everything up
								online. And finally, I have an external hard drive for Time Machine
								backups.
