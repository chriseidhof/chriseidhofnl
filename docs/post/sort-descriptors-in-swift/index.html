								Sort Descriptors in Swift
							</h1>
							<h2 class="headline">
								From Runtime Magic To Functions
							</h2>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								Just last week, someone asked me &quot;in what respect does Swift fall short of the
								
								dynamic features of Objective-C&quot;?
							</p>
							<p>
								Dynamic programming means a lot of different
								
								things to different people, and I think they meant runtime programming. In this
								
								post, we&apos;ll look at replacing Objective-C&apos;s runtime programming with
								
								Swift&apos;s functions.
							</p>
							<p>
								This post is an excerpt from the Functions chapter in <a href="https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/" title>Advanced
									
									Swift</a>, which we&apos;re currently
								
								rewriting (and making very good progress).  The text below was originally written by <a href="https://twitter.com/airspeedswift" title>Airspeed
									
									Velocity</a>. I took his text and code, updated
								
								everything for Swift 3 and made some heavy edits. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/olebegemann" title>Ole Begemann</a> for reading through a draft of this.
							</p>
							<hr/>
							<p>
								In the chapter on <a href="#collections" title>collections</a>, we talked about parametrizing
								
								behavior by passing functions as arguments. Let&apos;s look at another example of
								
								this: sorting.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you want to sort an array in Objective-C using Foundation, you are met with a
								
								long list of different options. These provide a lot of flexibility and power,
								
								but at the cost of complexity — even the simplest probably needs a trip to the
								
								documentation to know how to use it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sorting collections in Swift is simple:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">var myArray = [3, 1, 2]
myArray.sorted() // [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								There are really four sort methods: <code>sorted(by:)</code> and <code>sort(by:)</code>, times two for
								
								the overloads that default to sorting comparable things in ascending order. But
								
								the overloading means that when you want the simplest case, <code>sorted()</code> is all
								
								you need. If you want to sort in a different order, just supply a function:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">myArray.sorted(by: &gt;) // [3, 2, 1]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								You can also supply a function if your elements don&apos;t conform to <code>Equatable</code> but
								<em>do</em> have a <code>&lt;</code> operator, like tuples:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">var numberStrings = [(2, &quot;two&quot;), (1, &quot;one&quot;), (3, &quot;three&quot;)]
numberStrings.sort(by: &lt;)
numberStrings // [(1, &quot;one&quot;), (2, &quot;two&quot;), (3, &quot;three&quot;)]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								Or, you can supply a more complicated function if you want to sort by some
								
								arbitrary calculated criteria:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">let animals = [&quot;elephant&quot;, &quot;zebra&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;]
let sortedAnimals = animals.sorted { lhs, rhs in
    let l = lhs.characters.reversed()
    let r = rhs.characters.reversed()
    return l.lexicographicallyPrecedes(r)
}
sortedAnimals // [&quot;zebra&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;elephant&quot;]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								It is this last ability — the ability to use any comparison function to sort a
								
								collection — that makes the Swift sort so powerful, and makes this one function
								
								able to replicate much (if not all) of the functionality of the various
								
								different sorting methods in Foundation.
							</p>
							<p>
								To demonstrate this, let&apos;s take a complex example inspired by the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/SortDescriptors/Articles/Creating.html" title>Sort
									
									Descriptor Programming
									
									Topics</a>.
								
								The <code>sortedArray(using:)</code> method on <code>NSArray</code> is very flexible and a great
								
								example of the power of Objective-C&apos;s dynamic nature. Support for selectors and
								
								dynamic dispatch is still there in Swift, but the Swift standard library favors
								
								a more function-based approach instead. Later on, we&apos;ll show a few techniques
								
								where functions as arguments, and treating functions as data, can be used to get
								
								the same dynamic effects.
							</p>
							<p>
								We&apos;ll start by defining a <code>Person</code> object. Because we want to show how
								
								Objective-C&apos;s powerful runtime system works, we&apos;ll have to make it an <code>NSObject</code>
								subclass (in pure Swift, a struct might have been a better choice):
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">final class Person: NSObject {
    var first: String
    var last: String
    var yearOfBirth: Int
    init(first: String, last: String, yearOfBirth: Int) {
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth
    }

}
</code></pre>
							<p>
								Let&apos;s also define an array of people, with different names and birth years:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">let people = [
    Person(first: &quot;Jo&quot;, last: &quot;Smith&quot;, yearOfBirth: 1970),
    Person(first: &quot;Joe&quot;, last: &quot;Smith&quot;, yearOfBirth: 1970),
    Person(first: &quot;Joe&quot;, last: &quot;Smyth&quot;, yearOfBirth: 1970),
    Person(first: &quot;Joanne&quot;, last: &quot;smith&quot;, yearOfBirth: 1985),
    Person(first: &quot;Joanne&quot;, last: &quot;smith&quot;, yearOfBirth: 1970),
    Person(first: &quot;Robert&quot;, last: &quot;Jones&quot;, yearOfBirth: 1970),
]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								We want to sort this array first by last name, then by first name, and finally
								
								by birth year. We want to do this case insensitively and using the user&apos;s
								
								locale. An <code>NSSortDescriptor</code> object describes how to order objects, and we can
								
								use them to express the individual sorting criteria.
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">let lastDescriptor = NSSortDescriptor(key: &quot;last&quot;, ascending: true,
  selector: #selector(NSString.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare(_:)))
let firstDescriptor = NSSortDescriptor(key: &quot;first&quot;, ascending: true, 
  selector: #selector(NSString.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare(_:)))
let yearDescriptor = NSSortDescriptor(key: &quot;yearOfBirth&quot;, ascending: true)
</code></pre>
							<p>
								To sort the array, we can use the <code>sortedArray(using:)</code> method on <code>NSArray</code>.
								
								This takes a list of sort descriptors. To determine the order of two elements,
								
								it starts by using the first sort descriptor, and uses that result. However, if
								
								two elements are equal according to the first descriptor, it uses the second
								
								descriptor, and so on.
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">(people as NSArray).sortedArray(using: [lastDescriptor, firstDescriptor, yearDescriptor]) 
// [Robert Jones (1970), Jo Smith (1970), Joanne smith (1970), Joanne smith (1985), Joe Smith (1970), Joe Smyth (1970)]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								A sort descriptor uses two runtime features of Objective-C: the <code>key</code> is a key
								
								path, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Articles/KeyValueCoding.html" title>key-value
									
									coding</a>
								is used to lookup the value of that key at runtime. The <code>selector</code> parameter
								
								takes a selector (which is really just a <code>String</code> describing a method name). At
								
								runtime, the selector is turned into a comparison function. When comparing two
								
								objects, the values for the key are compared using that comparison function.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is a pretty cool use of runtime programming, especially when you realize
								
								the array of sort descriptors can be built at runtime, say based on a user
								
								clicking a column heading.
							</p>
							<p>
								How can we replicate this functionality using Swift&apos;s <code>sort</code>? It&apos;s simple to
								
								replicate <em>parts</em> of the sort, for example, if you want to sort an array using
								<code>localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare</code>:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">var strings = [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;hallo&quot;, &quot;Hallo&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;]
strings.sort { $0.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare($1) == .orderedAscending}
strings // [&quot;hallo&quot;, &quot;Hallo&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								If you want to sort using just a single property of an object, that&apos;s also
								
								simple.
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">people.sorted { $0.yearOfBirth &lt; $1.yearOfBirth } 
// [Jo Smith (1970), Joe Smith (1970), Joe Smyth (1970), Joanne smith (1970), Robert Jones (1970), Joanne smith (1985)]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								This approach doesn&apos;t work so great when optional properties are combined with
								
								methods like <code>localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare</code>, though — it gets ugly fast. For
								
								example, consider sorting an array of filenames by file extension (using the
								<code>fileExtension</code> property from the <a href="#optionals" title>Optionals</a> chapter):
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">var files = [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;file.h&quot;, &quot;file.c&quot;, &quot;test.h&quot;]
files.sort { l, r in r.fileExtension.flatMap { l.fileExtension?.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare($0) } == .orderedAscending }
files // [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;file.c&quot;, &quot;file.h&quot;, &quot;test.h&quot;]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								Later on, we&apos;ll make it easier to use optionals when sorting. However, for now,
								
								we haven&apos;t even tried sorting by multiple properties. To sort by last name, then
								
								first name, we can use the standard library&apos;s <code>lexicographicalCompare</code> method.
								
								This takes two sequences and performs a phonebook-style comparison by moving
								
								through each pair of elements until it finds one that isn&apos;t equal. So we can
								
								build two arrays of the elements and use <code>lexicographicalCompare</code> to compare
								
								them. It also takes a function to perform the comparison. We&apos;ll put our use of
								<code>localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare</code> in the function:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">let sortedPeople = people.sorted { p0, p1 in
    let left =  [p0.last, p0.first]
    let right = [p1.last, p1.first]

    return left.lexicographicallyPrecedes(right) {
        $0.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare($1) == .orderedAscending
    }
}
sortedPeople // [Robert Jones (1970), Jo Smith (1970), Joanne smith (1985), Joanne smith (1970), Joe Smith (1970), Joe Smyth (1970)]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								At this point, we&apos;ve almost replicated the functionality of the original sort in
								
								roughly the same number of lines. But there&apos;s still a lot of room for
								
								improvement: the building of arrays on every comparison is very inefficient, the
								
								comparison is hardcoded, and we can&apos;t really sort by <code>yearOfBirth</code> using this
								
								approach.
							</p>
							<h3>
								Functions as Data
							</h3>
							<p>
								Rather than writing an even more complicated function that we can use to sort,
								
								let&apos;s take a step back. So far, the sort descriptors were much clearer, but they
								
								use runtime programming. The functions we wrote do not use runtime programming,
								
								but they are not so easy to write (and read).
							</p>
							<p>
								A sort descriptor is a way of describing the ordering of objects. Instead of
								
								storing that information as a class, we can define a function to describe the
								
								ordering of objects. The simplest possible definition would take two objects,
								
								and returns <code>true</code> if they are ordered. This is also exactly the type that the
								
								standard library&apos;s <code>sort(by:)</code> and <code>sorted(by:)</code> methods take as an argument.
								
								It&apos;s helpful to define a generic <code>typealias</code> to describe sort descriptors:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">typealias SortDescriptor&lt;Value&gt; = (Value, Value) -&gt; Bool
</code></pre>
							<p>
								As an example, we could define a sort descriptor that compares two <code>Person</code>
								objects by year of birth, or a sort descriptor that sorts by last name:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">let sortByYear: SortDescriptor&lt;Person&gt; = { $0.yearOfBirth &lt; $1.yearOfBirth }
let sortByLastName: SortDescriptor&lt;Person&gt; = { 
  $0.last.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare($1.last) == .orderedAscending 
}
</code></pre>
							<p>
								Rather than writing the sort descriptors by hand, we can write a function that
								
								generates them. It&apos;s not nice that we to write the same property twice: in the
								<code>sortByLastName</code>, we could have easily made a mistake and accidentally compared
								<code>$0.last</code> with <code>$1.first</code>. Also, it&apos;s tedious to write these sort descriptors:
								
								to sort by first name, it&apos;s probably easiest to copy and paste the
								<code>sortByLastName</code> definition and modify it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Rather than copying and pasting, we can define a function with an interface that
								
								is much like <code>NSSortDescriptor</code>, but without the runtime programming. This
								
								function takes a key and a comparison method, and returns a sort descriptor (the
								
								function, not the class <code>NSSortDescriptor</code>). Here, <code>key</code> is not a string, but a
								
								function. To compare two keys, we use a function <code>isOrderedBefore</code>. Finally, the
								
								result type is a function as well, even though that is slightly obscured by the
								<code>typealias</code>.
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">func sortDescriptor&lt;Value, Key&gt;(
  key: @escaping (Value) -&gt; Key,
    _ isOrderedBefore: @escaping (Key, Key) -&gt; Bool) 
    -&gt; SortDescriptor&lt;Value&gt; {
    return { isOrderedBefore(key($0), key($1)) }
}
</code></pre>
							<p>
								This allows us to define <code>sortByYear</code> in a different way:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">let sortByYearAlt: SortDescriptor&lt;Person&gt; = sortDescriptor(key: { $0.yearOfBirth }, &lt;)
people.sorted(by: sortByYearAlt) 
// [Jo Smith (1970), Joe Smith (1970), Joe Smyth (1970), Joanne smith (1970), Robert Jones (1970), Joanne smith (1985)]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								We can even define an overloaded variant that works for all <code>Comparable</code> types:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">func sortDescriptor&lt;Value, Key&gt;(key: @escaping (Value) -&gt; Key)
    -&gt; SortDescriptor&lt;Value&gt; where Key: Comparable {
    return { key($0) &lt; key($1) }
}
let sortByYearAlt2: SortDescriptor&lt;Person&gt; = sortDescriptor(key: { $0.yearOfBirth })
</code></pre>
							<p>
								Both <code>sortDescriptor</code> above work with boolean functions. The <code>NSSortDescriptor</code>
								class has an initializer that takes a comparison function such as
								<code>localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare</code>. Adding support for this is easy as well:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">func sortDescriptor&lt;Value, Key&gt;(
    key: @escaping (Value) -&gt; Key,
    ascending: Bool = true,
    _ comparator: @escaping (Key) -&gt; (Key) -&gt; ComparisonResult
    ) -&gt; SortDescriptor&lt;Value&gt; {
    return { lhs, rhs in
        let order: ComparisonResult = ascending ? .orderedAscending : .orderedDescending
        return comparator(key(lhs))(key(rhs)) == order
    }
}
</code></pre>
							<p>
								This allows us to write our <code>sortByFirstName</code> in a much shorter and clearer way:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">let sortByFirstName: SortDescriptor&lt;Person&gt; = 
  sortDescriptor(key: { $0.first }, String.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare)
people.sorted(by: sortByFirstName) 
// [Jo Smith (1970), Joanne smith (1985), Joanne smith (1970), Joe Smith (1970), Joe Smyth (1970), Robert Jones (1970)]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								This <code>SortDescriptor</code> is just as expressive as its <code>NSSortDescriptor</code> variant,
								
								but it is typesafe, and it does not rely on runtime programming.
							</p>
							<p>
								Currently, we can only use a single <code>SortDescriptor</code> function to sort arrays. If
								
								you recall, we used the <code>NSArray.sortedArray(using:)</code> method to sort an array
								
								with a number of comparison operators. We could easily add a similar method to
								<code>Array</code>, or even to the <code>Sequence</code> protocol. However, we would have to add it
								
								twice: once for the mutating variant, and once for the non-mutating variant.
							</p>
							<p>
								We take a different approach so that we don&apos;t have to write more extensions.
								
								Instead, we write a function that combines multiple sort descriptors into a
								
								single sort descriptor. It works just like the <code>sortedArray(using:)</code> method: it
								
								first tries the first descriptor and uses that result. Unless the values are
								
								equal, then it uses the second descriptor, and so on.
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">func combine&lt;Value&gt;
    (sortDescriptors: [SortDescriptor&lt;Value&gt;]) -&gt; SortDescriptor&lt;Value&gt; {
    return { lhs, rhs in
        for isOrderedBefore in sortDescriptors {
            if isOrderedBefore(lhs,rhs) { return true }
            if isOrderedBefore(rhs,lhs) { return false }
        }
        return false
    }
}
</code></pre>
							<p>
								We can now finally replicate the initial example we had using sort descriptors:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">let combined: SortDescriptor&lt;Person&gt; = combine(
  sortDescriptors: [sortByLastName,sortByFirstName,sortByYear]
)
people.sorted(by: combined) 
// [Robert Jones (1970), Jo Smith (1970), Joanne smith (1970), Joanne smith (1985), Joe Smith (1970), Joe Smyth (1970)]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								We ended up with the same behavior as before. However, the version using
								
								functions is type-safe and does not rely on runtime programming, so it can be
								
								optimized by the compiler as well. And we can use it with structs, or
								
								non-Objective-C Objects.
							</p>
							<p>
								This approach of using functions as data — storing them in array and building
								
								those arrays at runtime — opens up a new level of dynamic behavior, and it is
								
								one way in which a statically typed compile-time-oriented language like Swift
								
								can still replicate some of the dynamic behavior of languages like Objective-C
								
								or Ruby.
							</p>
							<p>
								Also, it is possible to write functions that combine other functions. For
								
								example, our <code>combine(sortDescriptors:)</code> function took an array of sort
								
								descriptors, and combined them into a single sort descriptor. Alternatively, we
								
								could have written an operator to combine two sort functions:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">infix operator &lt;||&gt; : LogicalDisjunctionPrecedence
func &lt;||&gt;&lt;A&gt;(lhs: @escaping (A,A) -&gt; Bool, rhs: @escaping (A,A) -&gt; Bool) -&gt; (A,A) -&gt; Bool {
    return { x,y in
        if lhs(x,y) { return true }
        if lhs(y,x) { return false }
        
        // Otherwise, they&apos;re the same, so we check for the second condition
        if rhs(x,y) { return true }
        
        return false
    }
}
</code></pre>
							<p>
								Most of the time, writing a custom operator is a bad idea. Custom operators are
								
								often harder to read than functions, because the name isn&apos;t explicit. However,
								
								they can be very powerful when used sparingly. The operator above allows us to
								
								rewrite our combined sort example like so:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">let combinedAlt = sortByLastName &lt;||&gt; sortByFirstName &lt;||&gt; sortByYear
people.sorted(by: combinedAlt) 
// [Robert Jones (1970), Jo Smith (1970), Joanne smith (1970), Joanne smith (1985), Joe Smith (1970), Joe Smyth (1970)]
</code></pre>
							<p>
								That said, we prefer the <code>combine(sortDescriptors:)</code> function over the custom
								
								operator. It is clearer at the call-site, which makes for more readable code.
								
								Unless you are writing highly domain-specific code, a custom operator is
								
								probably overkill.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Foundation version still has one functional advantage over our version. It
								
								can deal with optionals without having to write any more code. For example, if
								
								we would make the <code>last</code> property on <code>Person</code> an optional string, we wouldn&apos;t
								
								have to change anything in our sorting code that uses <code>NSSortDescriptor</code>.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, all is not lost. You can feel it coming: once again, we write a
								
								function which takes a function and returns a function. We can take a regular
								
								comparing function such as <code>localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare</code>, which works on two
								<code>String</code>s, and turn it into a function that takes two optional <code>String</code>s. If
								
								both values are <code>nil</code>, they are equal. If the left-hand side is nil, but the
								
								right-hand isn&apos;t they&apos;re ascending, and the other way around. Finally, if they
								
								are both non-<code>nil</code>, we can use the <code>compare</code> function to compare them.
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">func lift&lt;A&gt;(_ compare: @escaping (A) -&gt; (A) -&gt; ComparisonResult) -&gt; (A?) -&gt; (A?) -&gt; ComparisonResult {
    return { lhs in { rhs in
        switch (lhs, rhs) {
        case (nil, nil): return .orderedSame
        case (nil, _): return .orderedAscending
        case (_, nil): return .orderedDescending
        case let (l?, r?): return compare(l)(r)
        default: fatalError() // Impossible case
        }
    } }
}
</code></pre>
							<p>
								This allows us to &quot;lift&quot; a regular comparison function into the domain of
								
								optionals, and it can be used together with our sortDescriptor function. If you
								
								recall the <code>files</code> array from before, sorting them by <code>fileExtension</code> got really
								
								ugly because we had to deal with optionals. However, with our new <code>lift</code>
								function, it&apos;s very clean again:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">let lcic = lift(String.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare)
let result = files.sorted(by: sortDescriptor(key: { $0.fileExtension }, lcic))
result // [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;file.c&quot;, &quot;file.h&quot;, &quot;test.h&quot;]
</code></pre>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									We can write a similar version of <code>lift</code> for functions that return a <code>Bool</code>.
									
									Before Swift 3, operators like <code>&gt;</code> were defined on optionals. They were
									
									removed because they can lead to accidental bugs. However, with a boolean
									<code>lift</code> you can easily take an existing operator and make it work for
									
									optionals.
								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								One drawback of the function-based approach is that functions are opaque. We can
								
								take an <code>NSSortDescriptor</code>, print it to the console, and we get some information
								
								about the sort descriptor: the key path, the selector name and whether it&apos;s
								
								ascending. Our function-based approach cannot do this. For sort descriptors,
								
								this is not a problem in practice. If it&apos;s important to have that information,
								
								we could wrap the functions in a struct or class, and store additional debug
								
								information.
							</p>
							<p>
								This approach has also given us a clean separation between the sorting method
								
								and the comparison method. The algorithm that Swift&apos;s sort uses is a hybrid of
								
								multiple sorting algorithms — as of writing, it is an
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort" title>introsort</a> (which is itself a hybrid
								
								of a quicksort and a heapsort), but it switches to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort" title>insertion
									
									sort</a> for small collections to
								
								avoid the upfront startup cost of the more complex sort algorithms.
							</p>
							<p>
								Introsort is not a
								
								&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stable_sorts" title>stable</a>&quot; sort. That is,
								
								it does not necessarily maintain relative ordering of values that are otherwise
								
								equal according to the comparison function.
							</p>
							<p>
								But if you implemented a stable sort, the separation of the sort method from the
								
								comparison would allow you to swap it in easily:
							</p>
							<pre><code class="swift">people.stableSorted(by: combine(
  sortDescriptors: [sortByLastName,sortByFirstName,sortByYear]
))
