								One of the things I love is Markdown. Recently, I’ve also been giving a lot more
								presentations. Working in Keynote can be really nice, and is very powerful. But
								most of the time, I don’t need that power.

							</p>
							<p>
								Therefore, <a href="http://floriankugler.com">Florian</a>, me and our awesome friends at <a href="http://www.acolorbright.com">A
									Color Bright</a> have spent the last months building
								an app that changes the way you write your presentations. You write a markdown
								file, separate your slides with dashes, and you get a beautiful presentation out
								of it. Update your markdown file, and your presentation updates
								automatically.

							</p>
							<p>
								Over the last weeks, we’ve given multiple presentations with the app, and it’s
								awesome. For me, it’s great that I can just write. Rearranging text is so much
								easier than rearranging slides. The default themes we have are beautiful by
								default, and it’s really hard to mess it up. Changing to a different theme is
								immediate: you can do this minutes before the presentation, if you feel like
								it.

							</p>
							<p>
								We are not building a replacement for Keynote or Powerpoint, but a different way
								of creating presentations. In some use cases, traditional tools are the way to
								go. But for many of the presentations, we think Deckset is much easier.

							</p>
							<p>
								Currently, we’re putting the finishing touches on our app, and are getting it
								ready for private beta. We are planning to launch early 2014. If this sounds
								interesting to you, go ahead and sign up for the mailing list at<a href="http://www.decksetapp.com">decksetapp.com</a>, and we’ll keep you posted.

							</p>
							<p>
								Have a great start of the year!
