								I’m still not running but really enjoying the biking. If my injury doesn’t improve soon I’ll start looking for some treatment instead. However, biking doesn’t cause any pain so maybe I should just keep enjoying that and not do anything else for a while.

								After my trip to Paris last month, we decided to go to Bologna, Italy by train, but this time with the whole family. We made two stops along the way (in Innsbruck and Verona) and after 9 trains and one bus we made it to Bologna. The <a href="https://pragmaconference.com">pragma conference</a> is always super fun, even though I haven’t been for a few years.

								I started playing around with <a href="https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/latest/">jujutsu</a> last week. I’ll try to experiment with it more, it looks to be extremely useful for some of my workflows with git (specifically rewriting history and editing older commits). At the moment, I use <a href="https://retcon.app">Retcon</a> for this (which is awesome).

								I started a <a href="http://github.com/chriseidhof/til">TIL</a> repository, let’s see if I can keep it up.

								I played around a bit with sqlite. It’s still kind of weird that there’s no one way to create personal databases these days. For example, I’d like to create an invoice system that’s backed by sqlite, but it’s so much code to write this. I’d like to make this easier.
