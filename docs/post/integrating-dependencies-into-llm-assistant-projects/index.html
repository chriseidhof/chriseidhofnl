								Integrating Dependencies into LLM-Assisted Projects

								Melting Code into your Codebase

							<p>
								The other week I met <a href="https://orta.io">Orta</a> again. When talking about LLM-assisted coding, we also discussed dependencies. He told me about an approach he’s been taking: he just integrates dependencies into his code by literally pasting in the files and then adjusting them as needed. He also <a href="https://github.com/puzzmo-com/tapped?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-tapped">recommends this</a> way of integrating for one of his projects. To me, it almost feels like “melting” the dependency into the codebase. You start owning the code the moment you integrate.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is very different from having a dependency manager where you depend on the code other people maintain. Over the years, even before LLMs, I’ve done the same with my own code. Rather than abstracting things out, I often would just paste in existing code and modify it for that project. With LLMs, it’s now become even easier to do that.
							</p>
							<p>
								Even Donald Knuth was skeptical about reusable code:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									I also must confess to a strong bias against the fashion for reusable code. To me, “re‐editable code” is much, much better than an untouchable black box or toolkit. […] (<a href="https://mmix.cs.hm.edu/other/knuth-interview.pdf">Source</a>)
								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								In any case, I’ve been moving towards <a href="https://chris.eidhof.nl/post/fewer-dependencies/">fewer dependencies</a> for years, maybe now even more? I’m curious about other changes that might happen as well.
