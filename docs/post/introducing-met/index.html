								Introducing Met
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								After yesterday’s post, a lot of people contacted me with ideas for a name.
								Thanks Pim, Martijn, Miles, Wilfred and Fabian (I hope I didn’t forget
								somebody). Some liked James, some liked Meetups, all with good reasons.

							</p>
							<p>
								However, one reply stood out: <a href="http://iksi.tv">Jurriaan</a> had an idea for a more
								minimalistic name: “Met”. Short and to the point. It’s about who you met. The
								best thing is: in Dutch it means “with”, and this is about who you were with.
								Awesome!

							</p>
							<p>
								Today I started designing a splash screen and an icon (see below). I also added
								an optional passcode lock (as this can be very private data). Getting the design
								and logic right took a bit of thinking and experimenting, but I think it’s good
								now. It’s enabled whenever you start the app, or resume the app (for example,
								after you lock the screen, switch to a different app or get a phone call).

							</p>
							<p>
								Martijn and Eelco send in a bunch of very good feature requests / tips today,
								thanks guys! To give a glimpse of my next actions:

							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										Pressed state for passcode buttons
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Use secure passcode storage (currently, I hacked it together using
										NSUserDefaults, which is unsafe)
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Swipe to delete
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Text color for selected tableview cells
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Link to Address Book from a contact / meetup
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Screen rotation support (as this gives you a bigger keyboard)
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								I will also add search, eventually. It’s a bit complicated, because I’ll have to
								compile my own sqlite library, and I’m a bit afraid that it might break in the
								future. However, analysis paralysis is a horrible thing, and making decisions is
								a good thing, so I decided to first do all the other stuff and then think about
								it again.
