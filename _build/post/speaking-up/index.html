								Speaking Up
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								Deciding when to speak up is one of the things where I feel I haven’t yet
								
								figured it out at all. I don’t know when or how to do it.

							</p>
							<p>
								In high school, a friend of mine didn’t like her boyfriend anymore. I told her
								
								that if she really feels that way then she should break up with him. The
								
								boyfriend (who was a good friend of me as well) was, understandably, quite angry
								
								at me. From that moment, I decided it wasn’t a good idea to speak up about other
								
								people’s relationships, even if I have strong opinions on it. However, recently,
								
								a friend told me he wished people would have told their true opinions about his
								
								ex-girlfriend. Mine was mildly negative, but I never said so to him. I don’t
								
								know if I should have done so.

							</p>
							<p>
								Being a programmer, I always get a lot of business-people looking for a
								
								programmer. They tell me their idea, and in my opinion, most of the ideas suck.
								
								Whenever I think this, I’ll try to postpone judgement and get my thoughts
								
								straight. I still feel it my professional responsibility to tell them why it is
								
								a bad idea and do so eventually. But where to draw the line? Do you tell thim
								
								“your idea sucks and here’s why”? Or “this is what I don’t like about your
								
								idea”. Maybe even “I don’t think you should try to become an entrepreneur” (I’ve
								
								never said that and not planning to do so either).

							</p>
							<p>
								One of the reasons why I find it hard to say what I’m thinking is because I have
								
								been wrong so many times. If Jack Dorsey would have pitched me Twitter, I
								
								probably would have strongly advised him not to pursue it as a business, because
								
								it doesn’t really add anything (we already had blogs, social networks, text
								
								messaging and email). Also, you need a lot of people for it to be interesting. I
								
								mean, seriously, a 140-character microblog is the best idea you can come up
								
								with? What problem does it solve anyway?
