							<h1>
								How a burnout changed my life
							</h1>
						</header>
						<section class="postbody">
							<p>
								In the previous two posts, I wrote about my burnout. First about how I got it,
								
								then about how I dealt with it. I have the feeling it has changed me
								
								permanently, but mostly in a good way.

							</p>
							<p>
								I don’t work as hard anymore. I don’t want to work weekends and evenings. Of
								
								course, every now and then I feel the urge to do something, but I try to resist.
								
								I read more, and take more time to socialize.

							</p>
							<p>
								My job has changed from mostly programming to building products. This includes
								
								programming, but also marketing, strategy, design, meeting people, writing and
								
								more. For me, this is a more healthy mix at the moment. It’s a big difference
								
								from freelancing.

							</p>
							<p>
								The biggest change was that <em>I see programming as a means, not an end</em>. This
								
								manifests itself in a number of ways. I’m not trying to write the perfect
								
								program, framework or language anymore. They don’t exist.

							</p>
							<p>
								Also, I don’t want to use Haskell for everything anymore. I don’t feel
								
								frustrated by using Objective C for iPhone programming, or Ruby for web
								
								programming. Whatever gets the job done fastest. Every now and then I think
								
								about building a better language, and maybe I will someday, but not now.

							</p>
							<p>
								For almost every problem, I try to find existing libraries. I did not suffer
								
								badly from the Not Invented Here Syndrome before, but now it got even better. I
								
								try to reuse code wherever possible, whether it’s somebody else’s code or my
								
								own.

							</p>
							<p>
								So far, I’m actually happy for the experience. A burnout is no fun, and it was
								
								scary for me, afraid that I would never be able to go back. I am confident that
								
								I now have found a better balance, and that I will be able to prevent it in the
								
								future. We’ll see!
